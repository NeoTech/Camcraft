description: Find open pull requests on NeoTech/Camcraft that need a review (third-party PRs from forks, or any PR whose current head has not been reviewed yet) and dispatch the PR-reviewer agent on each, one at a time. Posts review COMMENTS only - never approves or merges. Use when asked to "review the PRs", "check for new pull requests", "review PR #N", or from the periodic loop (`/loop 10m /review-prs`).

# Review open pull requests

The `PR-reviewer` agent (`.claude/agents/PR-reviewer.md`) does the review of
one PR. This skill decides which PRs need it and dispatches it. The maintainer
approves and merges by hand - nothing here approves, merges or pushes.

## 0. One review at a time - the lock

PR reviews never run concurrently (user, 2026-11-07: "make sure we are not
running concurrent PR reviews"): each one builds the whole workspace, and a
loop tick can fire while the previous review is still building. The lock is
the file `.claude/pr-review.lock` in the repo root (gitignored), one line:
`<PR number> <head sha> <UTC ISO time>`.

```bash
lock="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)/.claude/pr-review.lock"
if [ -f "$lock" ]; then cat "$lock"; find "$lock" -mmin +90; fi
```

- Lock present and younger than 90 min (the `find` prints nothing): a review
  is running. Say "a PR review is already running (#N since T)" in one line
  and stop - do not dispatch, do not queue.
- Lock older than 90 min: stale (a review that died). Check no
  `../cc-pr*-review` worktree is still building (`git worktree list`); if none,
  delete the lock, say "removed a stale PR-review lock (#N)", and go on.
  If a review worktree remains, remove it (`git worktree remove --force`,
  `git branch -D pr-<N>-review`) before going on.
- Also stop if a `PR-reviewer` agent you launched is still running in this
  session.

## 1. Find PRs that need a review

**Only PRs marked ready for review are reviewed - never a draft** (user,
2026-11-08: "Update the review-prs skill to only review PRs that is ready
to review"; AGENTS.md "Every PR opens as a draft"). A draft is still being
worked on and may take more pushes; reviewing it wastes a full build.

If the user named a PR (`/review-prs 58`), check it first:
`gh pr view <N> --json isDraft,state --jq '.isDraft, .state'`. If it is a
draft (or not open), say "PR #N is a draft - not reviewed until it is marked
ready (`gh pr ready N`)" in one line and stop. Otherwise take just that one
and go to step 2.

Otherwise list open PRs that are ready for review (non-draft) with their head SHA and reviews:

```bash
gh pr list --repo NeoTech/Camcraft --state open --limit 100 \
  --json number,isDraft,author,headRepositoryOwner,headRefOid,reviews,comments \
  --jq '.[] | select((.isDraft|not) and .headRepositoryOwner.login != "NeoTech")
        | .headRefOid as $s
        | select([.reviews[].body, .comments[].body] | map(select(contains("<!-- pr-reviewer: " + $s))) | length == 0)
        | "\(.number) \(.author.login) \($s)"'
```

Every line printed is a PR that needs a review:
- it comes from a fork - our own issue PRs are reviewed in the release cut by
  the main session (AGENTS.md "A cut goes PR review"), not here, unless the
  user named one;
- no review or comment carries the marker for its current head SHA (a new push
  after our last review means the contributor answered - review again).

Nothing to review: say "no PRs need review" in one line and stop (this is the
common case on a loop tick - keep it quiet).

## 2. Dispatch exactly one PR

Take the oldest PR needing review - **one per invocation**; the next loop tick
takes the next. Never launch two `PR-reviewer` agents at once.

1. Write the lock first:
   `echo "<N> <sha> $(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%MZ)" > "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)/.claude/pr-review.lock"`
2. Agent tool, `subagent_type: "PR-reviewer"`, run in the background, prompt:
   `Review PR #<N> of NeoTech/Camcraft (head <sha>). Follow your definition: comment only, own worktree, clean up, remove .claude/pr-review.lock when done.`
3. On its completion notification, make sure the lock is gone (delete it if
   the agent failed to) and that `../cc-pr<N>-review` is removed. Do not poll
   while it runs.

## 3. Report

One short line per PR: number, author, verdict, link to the posted review.
If a review could not be posted, say why. Do not merge, approve, label, or
close anything; do not reply on the contributor's behalf.

## 4. Apply outside contributors' claims

Contributors without Triage rights cannot add the `claimed` label or
assign themselves, and collaborators often claim by comment alone too, so
every claim comment from anyone but the owner account (agents post as the
owner) is checked; its claim is a comment (AGENTS.md "Outside
contributors' claims count"). On every run, after the PR steps, find
fresh claim comments that have not been applied yet:

```bash
since=$(date -u -d '-4 hours' +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ 2>/dev/null || date -u -v-4H +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)
gh api "repos/NeoTech/Camcraft/issues/comments?since=$since&per_page=100" --paginate \
  --jq '.[] | select((.body|test("^ *claimed:"; "i")) and (.user.login != "NeoTech"))
        | "\(.issue_url|split("/")|last) \(.user.login) \(.created_at)"'
```

For each line `<N> <login> <time>` (the window only finds claims made since
a recent tick; a claim applied earlier keeps its label and assignee and is
judged stale by AGENTS.md's rule - 4 h with no newer comment from the
claimant - not by this window; on the first run of a session, or after the loop was
off, widen it to `-7 days` so a claim kept fresh by later comments is not
missed - its freshness is then checked as in "held" below):
- **already applied** - the issue carries `claimed` and `<login>` is an
  assignee: skip silently (this keeps each 10-minute tick from replying
  again);
- **closed issue**: skip;
- **held by someone else** - it carries `claimed` and either the latest
  claim comment by another claimant (an agent's `claimed:` comment counts)
  or that claimant's newest comment is younger than 4 h, or no claim
  comment can be found at all (be conservative: a label without a findable
  claim is held): do not take it. Reply once - only if no comment after
  `<time>` already mentions `@<login>` - that it is in progress, naming
  the claimant and branch or PR;
- **otherwise**: `gh issue edit N --add-label claimed --add-assignee <login>`
  (if GitHub refuses the assignee, still add the label) and reply
  `gh issue comment N --body "Claim recorded for @<login> - label and assignee set (contributors without triage rights claim by comment). It goes stale after 4 h with no update from you."`
  If the old claim was stale, say "reclaimed from <old claimant> (stale)".

Report one line per applied claim; nothing found stays silent.

## Periodic run

`/loop 10m /review-prs` re-runs this every 10 minutes for the session
(recurring loops auto-expire after 7 days; cancel with CronDelete). Each tick is
a cheap `gh pr list`; an agent is only spawned when a fork PR has an
unreviewed head.
