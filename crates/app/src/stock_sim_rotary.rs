//! The rotary clause of the document stock (M13.1): which rotary
//! kinds the field eye cuts through the chord pre-pass
//! (`Stock::simulate_rotary`), at what pose tolerance, and why the
//! column VERDICT still refuses them by name. Provenance: our own
//! engines and the M13 radial law; nothing from vendor binaries.
//!
//! ## The law here
//!
//! - **The eye chords the turn; the verdict refuses it.** A rotary
//!   program's moves turn the part under a posed tool. The field eye
//!   (`stock_view`, `stock_play`) cuts them through `simulate_rotary`:
//!   every turning move chorded at the eye's own chord class, never
//!   the un-chorded station-to-station chord (the silent approximation
//!   the old `plan_program` refusal existed to stop). The column
//!   verdict (`simulate_document`) reads heights marched from above:
//!   under a laid bar's equator, and on every ring a standing bar's
//!   lower flank hides, a gouge sits beneath an untouched top and
//!   reads clean - so it does not judge, by name
//!   ([`ROTARY_VERDICT_REFUSAL`]); the radial verdict at generation
//!   governs, and the post gate shows "not judged".
//! - **The eye's pose tolerance is its chord law.** The field chords
//!   every arc at a quarter cell (`backend.rs`' `chord_tol`); the turn
//!   is chorded at the same sag ([`rotary_pose_tol`]), so the picture
//!   is one chord class throughout. Parity at the VERDICT class
//!   (1e-4 sag, sphere-cut columns within `FIELD_VERDICT_EPS` plus the
//!   centre sag) is proved per kind by `crates/app/tests/
//!   rotary_field_parity.rs`; the flute above the ball stands on each
//!   sub-chord's mid pose - a chord-class flank error (`L·α` up the
//!   axis), stated there and in the refusal, never hidden.
//! - **A slice turns from where the head stood.** `rotary_chords`
//!   reads a program's first move as standing on its own pose (no
//!   approach is invented); a playback slice starting mid-program
//!   would then skip its first move's turn. [`simulate_rotary_slice`]
//!   prepends a standing rapid at the pose the program held before the
//!   slice, so the turn is chorded, and the rapid cuts nothing.
