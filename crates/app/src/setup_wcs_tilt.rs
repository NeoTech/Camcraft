//! #1510: a milling setup whose WCS Z axis is tilted off the machine's
//! Z is refused at generation, by name. Every milling generator cuts
//! along the machine's Z (a 3+2 tilt is its own frame), and a rotated
//! work offset does not post (#315); a path generated there machines
//! the part as it lies, not as the tilted WCS shows - the wrong face,
//! reported as OK. A part is turned for a setup with its part alignment
//! (#326), never with the WCS. A WCS turned only about Z (a squared-up
//! 3-2-1 offset) still generates; the post's #315 clause refuses it.
//!
//! Provenance: our own design notes over the 3-axis tool axis (the
//! spindle is the machine's Z; RS-274 / ISO 6983 work offsets carry no
//! tool orientation); no vendor material consulted.
