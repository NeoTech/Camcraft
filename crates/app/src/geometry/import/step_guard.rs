//! A metered wrapper around the STEP importer's surfaces, so one face whose
//! tessellation never converges ends in a refusal by name instead of a
//! hang (#1536).
//!
//! Provenance: our own design (an evaluation budget on a parametric
//! surface); the subdivision it meters is truck's published
//! `parameter_division` (ricosjp, Apache-2.0) for most surface kinds, and
//! `step_division` for B-spline and NURBS faces (#1602). Nothing from any
//! CAM vendor.
//!
//! Why it is needed: truck's surface subdivision splits every parameter
//! cell whose midpoint stands off the bilinear patch of its corners by more
//! than the tolerance, and recurses until no cell splits. A B-spline that is
//! not continuous - an interior knot repeated past its degree - keeps one
//! cell "far" at every depth, so the recursion never ends (it outlives the
//! float resolution: a split at an unchanged midpoint still grows the
//! list). So does a range that runs far off the knot domain; the one known
//! source of that, a boundary point on a collapsed patch side, is settled
//! in `step_pole` (#1548) before it reaches the subdivision. It runs inside a rayon task we cannot
//! interrupt, and no facet is ever produced, so the facet budget never
//! fires.
//!
//! How it is bounded: each face's surface is wrapped in [`Metered`], which
//! counts every point truck evaluates on it during one tessellation pass.
//! B-spline and NURBS faces are subdivided by `step_division` called on the
//! wrapper, so every probe is counted (a division still splitting at its
//! sweep cap spends the whole budget at once); other surface kinds keep
//! their specialised division. The wrapper also stretches a B-spline or
//! NURBS face's parameters (`step_stretch`), and its parameter searches
//! settle poles and retry misses (`step_nearest`, #1602). Past the cap the wrapper answers every
//! evaluation with one fixed point: no cell is then "far", the subdivision
//! ends within one more sweep, and the importer refuses the model naming
//! the face - unless the trip came on a finer pass over a face proven
//! continuous, which keeps the coarser mesh (#1568). No thread is spawned
//! and none is left behind.
