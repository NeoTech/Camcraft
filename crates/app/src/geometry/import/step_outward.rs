//! A closed STEP solid wound inward is turned outward at import (#1617).
//! A file can wind every face of a solid inward, consistently, so no face
//! disagrees with a neighbour: the mesh then has a negative signed volume
//! and every facet normal points into the material. Only a body that is
//! closed, manifold and consistently wound (every shared edge used once in
//! each direction) with a clearly negative volume is turned; an open body
//! (a lone face, a shell with a gap), a non-manifold or mixed one, or one
//! with no volume is left as it is - its "outside" has no meaning.
//!
//! Provenance: the body verdict is `pick::winding` (signed volume by the
//! divergence theorem, Zhang & Chen ICIP 2001; the closed, consistently
//! oriented 2-manifold test, Botsch et al. "Polygon Mesh Processing" 2010
//! ch. 1). Reversing a triangle's vertex order reverses its normal by the
//! right-hand rule. Our own code, no vendor material.
