//! STEP reader: B-rep shells tessellated to triangles with the `truck`
//! geometry crates (ricosjp, Apache-2.0), used as a library dependency.
//!
//! Provenance: file syntax per ISO 10303-21; surface tessellation is truck's
//! own published algorithm - nothing here from any CAM vendor.
//!
//! Hardening notes (Prime Directive):
//! - `truck` panics on shells that are not oriented/closed. Every truck call
//!   on the parse path runs inside `catch_unwind`; a kernel panic becomes a
//!   clean `ImportError::Step`, logged, never propagated.
//! - Tessellation is ADAPTIVE: each shell is meshed coarse first, then refined
//!   toward a quality target only while the projected facet count stays inside
//!   a memory budget. A model that cannot tessellate at target quality still
//!   imports - at reduced fidelity, logged - instead of spiking memory and
//!   being thrown away.
//! - Facet collection is capped per shell while extracting, as a last line of
//!   defense on top of the tolerance schedule.
//! - Every face's surface evaluations are metered per pass (`step_guard`,
//!   #1536): a face whose subdivision never converges is refused by name
//!   instead of hanging inside truck, where nothing else can stop it.
//! - A boundary point on a collapsed patch side (the pole of a corner
//!   blend) keeps its parameters inside the knot domain (`step_pole`,
//!   #1548), and an edge on a `SURFACE_CURVE` is read from its 3D curve
//!   (`step_edge3d`, #1548): a rounded-edge solid then meshes closed
//!   instead of being refused or losing faces.
//! - A shell the file declares closed must mesh closed, and a face the
//!   kernel returns no mesh for is refused by name (`step_closed`, #1573):
//!   truck drops or mis-trims such faces without an error.
