//! STEP closed-shell law (#1573): a shell the file declares closed must
//! mesh closed, and a face the kernel returns no mesh for is refused by
//! name - never imported as a model with a wall missing.
//!
//! Provenance: ISO 10303-42 `closed_shell` (and `manifold_solid_brep`,
//! whose outer shell is closed by the schema); the seams between faces are
//! judged in `step_seams` - only a real gap is refused, a face wound
//! against its neighbours is flipped and a T-junction is closed.
//! Our own code; nothing from any CAM vendor.
//!
//! Why: truck skips a face whose boundary it cannot place (no polygon) and
//! trims wrongly a face whose boundary it places wrongly, with no error
//! either way. The mesh then has holes, and the stock simulation and every
//! verdict judge the program against a part with walls missing.
