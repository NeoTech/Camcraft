//! The stock term of an operation's stamp (issue #156): which operations
//! read the setup's stock while generating and verifying, and the digest
//! of the stock they read (shape kind, size, placement, mesh).
//!
//! Provenance: our own staleness model (M3.1, `stamp.rs`), specced from
//! the Prime Directive - a verdict judged against a stock that has since
//! moved is a verdict nobody gave, so the op must read Stale and the
//! post refuse it. No vendor material.

/// The stock reaches the generators through ONE seam: `collect_job`
/// hands every kind whose source is not the stock itself the stock's
/// world facets and box. From there it feeds the clearance top
/// (`stock_top_z`), the stock region the reach and entry laws widen
/// into, the rapid-in-stock column (#96) and footprint rings (#106),
/// the prior acquittal, the plunge-solid law of the 3D and multi-axis
/// kinds, the cross-drill standoff (#77), the axial drill's reach and
/// R-plane laws (#91) and the lathe meridian's bar (`revolved_bar`).
/// Every kind passes that seam, so every kind with a non-stock source
/// reads it. A stock-sourced op digests the stock as its source
/// already (the `SrcRef::Stock` arm), so it needs no second term.
