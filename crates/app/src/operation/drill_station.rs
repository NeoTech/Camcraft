//! The cross drill's holder on one station (issue #119): a move whose
//! pose lies along an XY axis and which slides along its own hole line,
//! across it, or in Z - never swinging round the bar - sweeps a
//! rectangular tube about that line. The material read in that tube
//! (`cross_entry::tube_reach`: a box at its face, a turned round at its
//! circumscribed reading) is what the holder's face must stand outside,
//! so a box stock no longer refuses a holder that clears its face but
//! not its corner circle. Any other move (the turret swinging between
//! quarter-turn stations, a pose off the XY axes) keeps the corner
//! radius in the holder's Z band (`drill_reach::cross_holder`).
//!
//! Provenance: a cylinder about a line lies inside the square tube of
//! its radius; a straight slide's swept footprint is the tube widened
//! by the slide - textbook geometry. Our own design notes; no vendor
//! material consulted.
