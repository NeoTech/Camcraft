//! The thread-milling operation's app half (#894): the door that judges tool and thread against each other by name, the kernel plan, and the gate on the readings the gouge laws take of a thread mill - a round wall, and the thread's own pitch.
//!
//! Provenance: ISO 724 / ISO 965-1 thread depths and public machine-tool
//! handbook thread milling, as `camcraft_tools::thread_mill` and
//! `machining2d::thread_mill` cite them; the door and the verdict
//! readings are our own design. No vendor material consulted.
//!
//! A thread is cut INTO the wall the model shows (CAD draws a tapped
//! hole at its minor diameter), so the tool's full cylinder against the
//! part would read every thread as a gouge. The two readings are #1071's
//! (`thread_rims`, `verify::thread_bore`): the tooth crests may reach the
//! major circle of the model's own wall and no further (the tangency law,
//! against `thread_rims::major_rims`), and the solid law excuses only the
//! thread's own wall and mouth, inside that major cylinder ([`bores`]).
//! Both apply only over a round wall ([`walls_round`], #1205).
