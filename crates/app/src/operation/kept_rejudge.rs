//! The post's live re-judge of the parts beside an operation's source
//! (#1628): what generation read through `keep_law::parts_in_stock` (a
//! stock source) and `keep_law::neighbour_parts` (a part source), read
//! again against the parts as they stand now.
//!
//! Provenance: our own design (`docs/decisions/1628-kept-parts-live-judge.md`)
//! over the solid and mark laws generation runs (`generate::contain_into`,
//! `mark_law::mark_into`). No vendor material consulted.
//!
//! ## The law
//!
//! Those parts are not in the op's stamp (the stamp contracts stand:
//! workholding never stales a path, a stock-based path never reads the
//! model, a fidelity refusal keeps its name). So a part moved into the
//! cut, added, un-tagged as a fixture, or un-marked as raw stock only
//! after a clean generation leaves the op `Ok` with a verdict nobody gave.
//! On an aligned stock the program sim judges every part live; where it
//! cannot judge (a turned stock, a posed path), the post gate
//! (`posting_sim`) calls [`moved_part_problem`] for each program op: the
//! cached path is judged again, with the very laws and numbers generation
//! used, against each kept part as it stands. A cut found is a refusal
//! naming the op and the part; nothing churns the op's status.
