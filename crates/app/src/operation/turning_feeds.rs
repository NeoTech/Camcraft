//! Issue #146: a boring bar's head and shank judged on its cutting FEEDS in the meridian (turning) plane against the material standing at each instant of the ride - the shop rule that a tool's body never rubs the work, only its edge cuts (machine-tool handbooks), read about the spindle as a body of revolution; our own design, no vendor material consulted.
