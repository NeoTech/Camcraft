//! Multiple setups: who machines against which stock and which WCS
//! (M3.2 stage A; one WCS per setup since #342).
//!
//! Provenance: our own design; the setup/WCS concept is standard
//! machine-shop practice (a setup is one clamping of the part against one
//! datum system; a flip is an unclamp, a re-clamp with the parts' faces
//! exchanged, and a datum transfer, not an axis rotation). No vendor
//! implementation inspected.
//!
//! ## The laws here
//!
//! - **The implicit-setup law.** A world with no `SetupDef` entity
//!   resolves exactly the way it did before this module existed: stock
//!   is the entity named `STOCK_NAME`, the WCS is the entity `G54`. The
//!   first `CreateSetup` on such a world MATERIALIZES `Setup1` pointing
//!   at those same existing entities - nothing is renamed, so every
//!   path, stamp and saved file predating setups keeps working
//!   untouched. `None` anywhere a setup is expected means "the first
//!   setup by name", which collapses to that same legacy behavior.
//! - **One order law, shared by call.** [`operation_order`] is THE
//!   program sequence: setup rank first, explicit operation position
//!   within a setup (name order for legacy operations without a position)
//!   (`Setup1` before `Setup2`, always). The post, re-machining, the
//!   document sim and batch regenerate all call this one function,
//!   upgrading M3.1 D's "shared by reference" to "shared by call" -
//!   re-machining and the machine can still not disagree, now including
//!   across setups.
//! - **Placement is the flip.** Setup space IS model/world space in a
//!   Z-up 2.5D engine: what changes between setups is where the stock
//!   sits (its `Location`, quaternion included) and where the datum
//!   sits - never a rotated machine axis. The axis-rotation form of a
//!   flip belongs to M3.3's orientation law; until then a flipped
//!   setup is a re-placed (or copied-and-flipped) stock, which is what
//!   the datum-transfer command builds.
//! - **Inert until named** (AGENTS.md M1.6 law). The active-setup
//!   singleton is read only at command creation (what setup new
//!   furniture and new operations join); nothing digests it, so making
//!   another setup active staleness-floats no path. An operation's
//!   `setup` field, by contrast, flows into its stamp through the
//!   RESOLVED heights - a setup change that moves the stock or a WCS
//!   marks the operations that machine against it, all by machinery
//!   that already existed.
//! - **Rest masks are same-setup only** (stage A limitation, logged in
//!   RECOMMENDED.md): re-machining looks at operations in the
//!   CONSUMER's setup ahead of it. A cross-setup mask would need to
//!   transform one setup's cut state into the other's placement; until
//!   that engine exists, a later setup re-cuts conservatively (the mask
//!   law means that is wasted air time, never a gouge).
