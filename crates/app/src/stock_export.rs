//! What the program leaves, as a mesh (M7.2 D): the traced stock's
//! field iso-extracted (`stock_sim::iso`) and written as binary STL.
//! Provenance: the binary STL layout (80-byte header, u32 count, 50
//! bytes a facet - the 3D Systems format as publicly documented) and
//! the M7.1 field; our own code, nothing from vendor binaries.
//!
//! ## The laws here
//!
//! - **The mesh is a cache of the field, never a second truth.** It is
//!   derived from the same `FieldView` the viewport traces, and keyed by
//!   it (`MeshCache`): a new view - any cut appended, any edit re-armed
//!   - is a new mesh; nothing reads the triangles back as material.
//! - **A hole is a refusal.** An extraction that is not watertight is
//!   never written: the file would claim a solid it is not.
