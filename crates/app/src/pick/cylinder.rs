//! The cylinder-angle alignment (#771): one curved-wall pick (a bore's
//! or cylinder's welded wall) names the wall's axis, and the axis
//! lands on a chosen world axis, turned by an angle about it.
//!
//! The axis reading is the wall's own geometry, not a guess: every
//! facet normal of a cylinder wall is perpendicular to the axis, so
//! any two non-parallel wall normals cross exactly along it. The
//! first facet normal and the wall normal most perpendicular to it
//! give a well-conditioned pair (magnitude sin of their angle, never
//! zero for a curved weld); every other normal is then verified
//! against that axis - a mixed patch that is not one cylinder wall is
//! refused by name, never silently misread. The axis direction is
//! read in the setup frame (through the part's placement and the
//! setup's current part alignment, so it composes after a
//! face-to-plane lay, #330); a flip reverses its sense (which way
//! the angle turns about it). The frame is built with the axis in
//! the chosen world axis's slot, the other columns from the world
//! axis least aligned with it (so the frame is never degenerate),
//! and the typed angle turns the result about the world axis it
//! landed on. The part turns about the centre of its bounds, as the
//! setup holds them, so it stays on its spot of the table. Pure:
//! the result is the setup's new part alignment, handed to
//! `AlignPartToSetup`; the work offset is never touched.
//!
//! Provenance: our own design over plain fixture practice (indicate
//! a bore's wall and swing the angle about its axis); the
//! normals-perpendicular-to-the-axis property of a cylinder is
//! textbook surface geometry. No vendor material consulted.
