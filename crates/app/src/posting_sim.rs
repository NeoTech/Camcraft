//! The verification gate's stock-sim clause: the program-level material
//! verdict, and - when the sim cannot judge - a NAMED not-judged line.
//! Provenance: our own design (the Prime Directive's "correct, or
//! visibly refused" read onto the M2.3 D gate); nothing from vendor
//! material.
//!
//! ## The law here
//!
//! The material sim (`stock_sim::simulate_document`) refuses programs
//! it cannot model - the turn family's half-plane, rotary sectors,
//! posed (tilted-tool) moves, a rotated stock, a later setup's model
//! stock, no stock at all. Before this clause that refusal was dropped
//! on the floor: the post went ahead and nothing said the material was
//! never judged. Now the refusal is ALWAYS visible - it rides the post
//! result, the status line and the G-code viewer's header as "stock
//! sim did not judge this program: <reason>".
//!
//! Whether it BLOCKS turns on the second judge. Every operation that
//! posts was generated through `operation::generate`, whose verify
//! pass (the depth-aware laws, the envelope scan, the revolved and
//! rotary verdicts) judges each path against the part and caches its
//! convictions as warnings - and any cached warning already blocks the
//! post (all but the scallop note, M13.9: a spacing's surface-quality
//! reading, shown and never binding - `Warning::blocks_post`). So a
//! fresh, stamped op with a silent cache HAS a clean
//! generator-time verdict (a convicted one blocks on its own WARN
//! records, by name), and the sim's silence alone is "unjudged at
//! program level", not "unsafe": it posts, loudly labelled. An op that
//! cannot show that verdict (no stamp, not fresh, or the op list itself
//! unreadable) has no judge at all, and then the not-judged line is a
//! blocking problem - two missing verdicts never add up to a pass.
//!
//! One input of that verdict is not in the stamp: the parts beside an
//! op's source its part laws keep (#1607, #1621). A part moved, added or
//! un-tagged after generation leaves the op fresh, so with the sim silent
//! those parts are judged again live (`operation::kept_rejudge`, #1628):
//! a cut into one is a blocking problem naming the op and the part.
