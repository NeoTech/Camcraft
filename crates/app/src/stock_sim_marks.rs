//! The marks the program declares (#1595): the program sim credits an
//! Engrave's or a Trace's cut into the finished part only as the mark
//! its OWN operation carries a law for - its cutter's sweep, no deeper
//! than the operation's mark budget (`operation::mark_law`). The budget
//! is computed here from the operation's parameters and tool as they
//! stand, never read from a cached record, so file data cannot state a
//! deeper mark than the operation does (the #529 bound, by
//! construction). An operation on any other kind declares no mark and
//! is judged against the sharp model - stricter, never looser. Since
//! #1607 a stock-source Engrave or Trace declares its mark too: its
//! operation holds it to the same budget against the setup's parts.
//!
//! Provenance: our own wiring of this repo's mark law onto the sim
//! crate's `credit_marks`. No vendor material consulted.
