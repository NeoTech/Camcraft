//! Workholding in a carried setup (#321): a setup entered with the body
//! the earlier setups machined (#317) holds THAT body, not its declared
//! block - so its fixtures are read against the carried stock. A fixture
//! standing inside the material the program really carries in (a vise
//! jaw modelled into a wall setup 1 left standing, a clamp on a face that
//! is still there) is workholding that cannot be where it is modelled:
//! every fixture verdict of that setup judged steel the machine will not
//! hold there, and the post is refused by name.
//!
//! Provenance: our own design per #308's research decision (the carried
//! body is the incoming stock, read through each setup's transform);
//! plain re-clamp practice from machine-tool handbooks. No vendor
//! material consulted.
//!
//! ## The laws here
//!
//! - **The carried body, not the declared block.** Only the body the
//!   setup is ENTERED with is read (`rest::entered_body`, the carried-body
//!   cache's entry): a clamp seated in a pocket setup 1 cut, inside the
//!   declared block but clear of the real material, is no conflict.
//! - **Penetration, not contact.** A column counts when its centre lies
//!   strictly inside the fixture's footprint and its material
//!   (`floor..top`) overlaps the fixture's Z span by more than
//!   [`FIXTURE_HIT_TOL`] - jaws gripping a side face and a part seated on
//!   a plate are contact by design. A footprint narrower than a cell
//!   (holding no centre) is judged by the column under its own centre. The column sampling resolves to the
//!   carried grid's pitch: an overlap narrower than half a cell beside a
//!   face can pass, and is stated so in the decision record.
//! - **Live, like every workholding law.** Read at the post gate against
//!   the steel as it stands now, never baked into a stamp (`fixture`'s
//!   live-gate law). The machine table is not read: the table is what the
//!   setup's stock stands on, not steel placed against it.
//! - **Unreadable is not clear.** A carry the gate cannot read leaves the
//!   ops of that setup refused by their own generation (#318/#319); this
//!   clause adds nothing for it, it never reads the declared block instead.
