//! The steel a closed fixture mesh puts on one vertical line (#1530):
//! the Z spans where the line `x = x0, y = y0` runs inside the solid.
//! The carried-workholding gate reads it per carried-stock column, so a
//! vise is judged by its jaws, not by the box that spans the part they
//! grip, and a nest pocket by its walls and floor.
//!
//! Provenance: ray-crossing inclusion with signed crossings along one
//! axis (the winding number of a closed oriented surface; Haines, "Point
//! in Polygon Strategies", Graphics Gems IV, 1994; O'Rourke,
//! "Computational Geometry in C", 2nd ed., ch. 7) - the same reading as
//! [`super::ray`], cast along +Z through every crossing instead of from
//! one point. Barycentric point-in-triangle in the XY projection is
//! textbook (Ericson, "Real-Time Collision Detection", 2005, 3.4). Our
//! own code.
//!
//! ## Why the answer is conservative
//!
//! A line through facet interiors only, transversally, reads the
//! winding exactly. A line through a facet edge or vertex, or running
//! in a facet's plane (a vertical wall face), is AMBIGUOUS: the line is
//! nudged (a millionth of the mesh's scale, at most 0.1 micron a step) and
//! read again. When every nudge is
//! ambiguous the answer is `None` and the caller judges by the box.
