//! The turning insert's swept solid on the field (M13.1 owed, #19):
//! the revolved stadium about a STATED lathe axis. Split from
//! `field_cut.rs` by the 400-line law.
//!
//! Provenance: the solid of revolution of a half-plane stadium (the
//! nose circle swept along its centre chord, the M5.2 E nose-centre
//! envelope) - plain plane geometry: the nearest point of a solid of
//! revolution to a query lies in the query's own meridian, so the
//! 2-D stadium distance in (radius, station) IS the 3-D distance.
//! Point-to-line projection for the meridian coordinates. Nothing
//! from vendor binaries.
//!
//! ## The laws here
//!
//! - **The axis is data, not a convention.** The turning kernels write
//!   world points in the plane of their fitted axis (`turning::Frame`):
//!   the axis stands wherever the part does. The sweep reads each
//!   endpoint's (radius, station) about that line; `LatheAxis::Z` (the
//!   world +Z through the origin) is the case the sim's own suite and
//!   `Stock::simulate_lathe` keep.
//! - **A chord keeps its side.** The second endpoint's radius is
//!   signed against the first's radial direction, so a parting chord
//!   that runs past the centre is the meridian segment it is (7 to -1,
//!   not 7 to 1); the distance reads both signs of the query's radius,
//!   so the kerf disc is exact either way.
//! - **A chord lies in one meridian, or is refused.** The flat
//!   (radius, station) segment is the swept solid only when both ends
//!   share a plane through the axis. A chord skewed to the axis sweeps
//!   a hyperboloid whose waist is nearer the axis than either end: the
//!   flat reading would show LESS removed than was cut, so such a
//!   chord refuses by name ([`LatheAxis::chord_in_meridian`]). The test
//!   is the out-of-plane offset `|ra x rb| / max(|ra|, |rb|)` against
//!   [`MERIDIAN_TOL`], so a chord through or near the axis (parting
//!   past centre) passes - its radial vectors are (anti)parallel or
//!   vanish.
//! - **The footprint is the tool's (#21).** The nose disc sweeps its
//!   bare chord dilated by the nose (the stadium above); a grooving or
//!   parting blade, a threading V and a form crown sweep their own
//!   convex meridian polygon (`field_blade`): the hull of the polygon
//!   at both chord ends, read in the query's meridian both signs, the
//!   same exact half-plane reading.
//! - **Total input.** A non-finite or zero axis refuses by name before
//!   a cell is written (`LatheAxis::new`).
