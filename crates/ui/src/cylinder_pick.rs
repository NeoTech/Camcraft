//! The cylinder-angle pick draft (#771): while a Setups page row
//! collects, a viewport Face click on a curved wall lands here instead
//! of in the open operation's geometry. One wall - a bore's or
//! cylinder's welded wall names its axis (the app reads the axis from
//! the wall's own facet normals, `align_from_cylinder`); a click
//! replaces it. #554's rule mirrored: faces only - arming sets Face
//! mode, so a click near an edge still takes the face, and an edge
//! that arrives anyway is refused by name (an edge cannot name a
//! cylinder's axis; edges set an axis, `crate::axis_pick`). Whether
//! the picked face is a curved wall is the app's reading at Apply,
//! which refuses a flat face by name. Ephemeral view state like the
//! plane draft - nothing here writes the world; Apply queues the
//! undoable `AlignPartToSetup` through `CommandKind::AlignPartCylinder`.
//!
//! Provenance: our own UI over plain datum-face practice; no vendor
//! material consulted.
