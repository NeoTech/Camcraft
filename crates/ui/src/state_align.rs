//! The Setups page's part-alignment verbs, dispatched (#326, #330, #555,
//! #557, #606; split out of `state.rs` for #738): every one lands as one
//! undoable `AlignPartToSetup`. The preset / "Turn by" row
//! (`CommandKind::TurnPart`), the face, three-point and axis picks all
//! move the part from where it sits now (#738); `AlignPart` stays the
//! absolute turn ("As modelled" resets through it). A refusal names
//! itself on the status line and writes nothing.
//! Provenance: our own routing over our own commands; no vendor material.
