//! The viewport's pick marks (#1505, #1507): one style for what an
//! operation's Geometry has selected and one, clearly different, for what
//! the pointer is over - the edge a click would take, a selected entity's
//! Geometry-list row (the pick that row's remove button would delete). Both
//! are screen-space strokes drawn over the model with a dark halo, so they
//! read on the shaded and the wireframe model in either theme. Hover is
//! ephemeral view state: nothing here is a command.
//!
//! Provenance: our own overlay styling; the stroke widths are plain UI
//! choices, no vendor material consulted.
