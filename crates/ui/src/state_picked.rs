//! Open model / Open project where the file arrives as bytes (#31): the
//! browser's async picker (`crate::file_pick`) delivers a name and the
//! file's contents, and they run through the same commands a file opened
//! from disk runs - `ImportModel` (one undo step) for a model, the project
//! loader for a `.camproj`. A file the browser could not read, or one the
//! importer refuses, is said on the status line by name; nothing changes.
//! Native builds keep their synchronous dialogs; the inbox they drain each
//! frame stays empty there.
//! Provenance: our own routing over the app's import and project laws.
