//! A setup's own pages, opened from its browser nodes (#343): the setup's
//! settings (active radio, stock source, part alignment, WCS label), its
//! Machine and Post (own, or following the document's), its Fixtures and
//! its Tool list. Every change is a queued command - `ActivateSetup`,
//! `SetupOwnMachine` / `SetupOwnPost`, the machine and post verbs (routed
//! to the setup's own mount, `state::setup_mount`), the fixture verbs -
//! so undo walks each one back.
//!
//! The mounted machine and post are the ACTIVE setup's (the one-mount
//! law, `camcraft_app::setup_mount`): a page of an inactive setup edits
//! nothing until it is activated, so no click can change a setup the
//! page does not name. (The browser activates a setup before it opens
//! one of its nodes, so this guard only shows after a later radio click.)
//!
//! Provenance: our own page law (issue #343, the maintainer's per-node
//! behaviour); no HSMWorks material consulted.
