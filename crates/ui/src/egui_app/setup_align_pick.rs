//! The Setups page's part-alignment control (#326): how the part sits on
//! the table in one setup. #738 made the page one flow: every move -
//! this row's preset and "Turn by", then the face, three-point and axis
//! picks below it - starts from where the part sits NOW and is one undo
//! step, so no row silently wipes what another did. "As modelled" is the
//! one reset, named as such. A preset turns about the part's centre;
//! typed angles turn about the setup's WCS origin by default (#606), or
//! the part's centre, by choice - the row says which. Every change queues
//! the undoable `AlignPartToSetup` (`CommandKind::TurnPart`, or
//! `CommandKind::AlignPart` for the reset); nothing here writes the
//! world. The work offset is a separate row (its own picker).
//!
//! Provenance: our own UI over plain shop practice (re-clamping a part
//! face-down or turned); no vendor material consulted.
