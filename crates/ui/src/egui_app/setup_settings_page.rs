//! The setup's own Settings page, laid out like the WCS page (#1440, after
//! #739): titled groups - which setup is active, where its stock comes
//! from, how the part sits, its work offset, the workholding limit (a
//! turning setup only) and the setup's two actions as equal buttons filling
//! the pane's width - then one readout line at the foot. With no setups the
//! page is the one "First setup" group. The groups only frame the pickers
//! the page always had (`setup_stock_pick`, `setup_align_pick`, ...); every
//! change is the same undoable command (`ActivateSetup`,
//! `SetSetupStockSource`, `AlignPart`, `DeleteSetup`, ...) and no command or
//! project field is new.
//!
//! Provenance: our own layout over the `layout` form helpers; no vendor
//! material.
