//! The status strip's alert reading (#192): a refusal on the status line
//! is drawn so it cannot be missed - the palette's error ink, bold, on an
//! error-tinted band, behind a "!" marker - until the next status
//! replaces it. Ordinary status text (saved, generated, ready) stays as
//! it was, dim. Provenance: our own UI law.
