//! The shared kind editors the family pages call (split out of
//! `pages.rs` with the property grid, user review 2026-11-06): the
//! roughing twins' pane, the 5-axis lead / lag / tilt trio, the shank
//! avoidance switch, the swarf and rotary panels. Rows ride the `layout`
//! form helpers; every value edits the page draft.
//!
//! Provenance: our own port of the M-c / M5.1 page code (each motion law
//! named in its doc comment lives in its own crate with its sources); no
//! vendor material involved.
