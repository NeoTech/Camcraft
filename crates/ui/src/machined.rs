//! The machined stock in the viewer (M13.1 owed): the mesh the field
//! view extracts (`stock_export::MeshCache`, the STL export's cache)
//! stands in the stock slot of the 3D view, and the hover's stock hit
//! is read against it - so what the pointer reports is what the eye
//! sees, not the uncut box it replaced. Provenance: our own code over
//! the M7.2 D cache; nothing from vendor binaries.
//!
//! ## The laws here
//!
//! - **One extraction per view, never per frame.** `prime` extracts
//!   when the whole-program view lands (`actions::walk_whole_program`),
//!   and says a refusal once; every frame after reads `mesh`, which
//!   only ever returns what is already cached.
//! - **The transport reads nothing here.** A playback view changes
//!   every frame; its triangles would cost a marching pass a frame.
//!   While the transport is up the traced eye and the sheet stand, as
//!   before - the mesh is the whole program's, transport down.
//! - **The eye still paints over it.** The GPU eye (`trace::eye`)
//!   replaces the stock slot when it traces; the mesh is what stands
//!   there when it does not - no eye, a refused march, a headless run.
//! - **Judged once, by the eye's law (#25).** `prime` classifies the
//!   mesh's facets with the extraction (`MeshCache::classify`, the
//!   eye's lattice and gate); the scene reads the cached classes, so
//!   the mesh paints the same clean / rest / gouge / unjudged legend.
//! - **The hovered facet lights (#25).** A stock hover answered by the
//!   mesh keeps the triangle it hit (`State::hover_mesh`, view state,
//!   never a command); `hover_facet_uv` projects it for the shell's
//!   draw list - nothing is re-uploaded when the pointer moves.
