//! Issue #54: the rotary wrap on a bar that is not a pure revolve - a
//! D-flat (a planar flat ground part of the way round the bar). Specced
//! from the wrap/development construction in `multiaxis::rotary_offset`
//! (a closed solid develops to a sheet whose only free edges are the
//! seam's two copies) and plain solid-modelling topology (a closed
//! 2-manifold has no free edge); no vendor material consulted.
//!
//! Read here: a D-flat bar clear of the wrap's seam wraps (flat through
//! the ends, a closed flat) and its Offset-rings rough keeps every cut tip
//! out of the part's true cross-section; a flat ACROSS the seam, on or
//! off its centre line, is refused by name (PR #210's review: wrapped, it
//! gouged to the axis); a bar with a facet missing is refused by name.
//!
//! Gate map (M4.4): covers camcraft_motion::multiaxis (rotary_offset,
//! rotary_seam), on
//! this suite's own prism fixtures.
//! Lane shape (M4.4): every wrap here is Offset rings or a refusal;
//! the suite runs in about a minute in debug.
