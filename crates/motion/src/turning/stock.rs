//! Issue #130: the revolved stock envelope the turning kernels approach from - the bar's outer radius about the part's axis, read by the app layer as the meridian rapid law reads it; the shop rule that a lathe tool approaches and retracts clear of the bar's OD and roughs from it down (machine-tool handbooks). Issue #229: the bar's far end, so a pass that ends inside a longer bar leaves its cut at feed. Our own design, no vendor material consulted.

/// The setup stock as a turning kernel reads it: the outer radius the
/// bar reaches about the part's own fitted axis, the radial clearance
/// every approach and retract keeps over it, and where the bar ends
/// along that axis. `None` where a
/// kernel takes an `Option<StockEnv>` is "no stock readable": the
/// kernel keeps its part-based approach.
