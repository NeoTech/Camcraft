//! The point-concurrency guard of the axis fit (issue #208). The
//! concurrency law of `axis.rs` asks whether each facet's normal line
//! meets the candidate axis, and that test cannot tell a pencil of
//! lines through ONE POINT from lines meeting a line: a two-triangle
//! face anchors its line at the face centre, so a box's faces all
//! pass through the box centre, and a single-band wall's lines all
//! pass through the bar's mid point. Lines through one point meet
//! EVERY line through it. On a plate or cube with a small turned boss
//! the boss lends its bearings to the coarseness gate and the plate's
//! faces "meet" a 45-degree line through their centre: a trusted
//! wrong axis.
//!
//! A pencil of lines through a point carries no direction of its own,
//! so it may certify an axis only when it is itself rotationally
//! symmetric about it - the Gauss map of a surface of revolution is a
//! union of circles about the axis: each ring's normals keep ONE angle
//! to the axis and bear every azimuth. So the inliers are peeled into
//! pencils (the point their lines meet best, least trimmed squares on
//! the area, then the next among the rest) and each pencil is judged
//! by itself. Its facets, sorted into latitude classes (`n . u`), must
//! each hold a ring (flats meeting the axis at a ring's latitude ride
//! with it: a D-flat, a square plate round a bore); a crossing rod
//! folds onto two bearings at many latitudes and holds none. And its
//! latitude must not run with the bearing: a skewed rod's ring, seen
//! from another axis, swings its latitude once per turn. A pencil
//! holding half the inliers must also pass the coarseness gate alone.
//! The coarseness gate itself reads only facets that meet the axis
//! (`axis.rs`), so an outlier boss lends nothing.
//!
//! Provenance: the Gauss map of a surface of revolution (do Carmo,
//! Differential Geometry of Curves and Surfaces) and the concurrency
//! of its normal lines with the axis (Pottmann & Randrup 1998);
//! least-squares point of nearest approach to a set of lines, least
//! trimmed squares (Rousseeuw 1984), and the trigonometric regression
//! of linear on circular data (Mardia & Jupp, Directional Statistics). Written from those sources and
//! our own design notes; no vendor material.
