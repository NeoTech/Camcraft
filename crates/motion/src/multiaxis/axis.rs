//! The rotation-axis finder of the rotary kinds (M5.1 stage E). A
//! turned part is a SURFACE OF REVOLUTION, and the classical law for
//! one is written by its normals: every surface normal line meets the
//! axis (on a cylinder it meets it squarely, on a cone or a bowl
//! obliquely). So the axis is the line that best meets all the
//! normal lines of the mesh - a least-squares concurrency fit:
//! direction from the extremal eigenvector of the area-weighted
//! second moment of the normals, position from the linear equations
//! `(n x u) . o = (n x u) . p` each normal line gives, pinned to the
//! canonical `o . u = 0` foot of the axis.
//!
//! Each facet's line is its plane normal anchored at the triangle's
//! CIRCUMCENTER, and that anchor is the whole craft of this: a
//! facet of a turned mesh has two vertices on one ring, so its
//! circumcenter - equidistant of all three - sits on the ring
//! chord's perpendicular bisector, which is a plane through the
//! true axis. The facet's normal is perpendicular to that chord
//! too, so the line stands in the meridian half-plane of its own
//! bearing: on a true revolve it meets the axis EXACTLY, at any
//! tessellation. Anchor the same normal at the centroid instead and
//! the line misses by a sixth of the arc first-order; weld the
//! mesh and average normals at a shared vertex and the triangle
//! fan's one-diagonal asymmetry misses by a quarter of it - both
//! refuse well-turned parts. What circumcenter anchoring cannot
//! see is flatness masquerading as roundness, so coarseness gets
//! its own honest gate: a turned zone's facets sweep their bearings
//! around the axis; a facade whose widest bearing skip is g stands
//! in for a wall whose chords sag `rho * g^2 / 8` - the skip must
//! stay inside the sagitta budget. Facing flats bear no azimuth
//! and justly take no part: shoulders are sharp where lathes leave
//! them so. Miss concurrency everywhere and the model is not a
//! surface of revolution, and the refusal says which kind wants it
//! instead. A sphere answers EVERY axis equally well (its normals
//! are concurrent at a point) and is refused as what it is: domed
//! ground for the 5-axis kinds of stage C.
//!
//! Provenance: axis-of-revolution detection by normal-line
//! concurrency is standard point-cloud geometry (the published
//! survey of revolved-surface fitting); the least-squares line fit
//! from plucker-like rows is textbook. Written from those sources
//! and our own design notes - nothing of any vendor's consulted.
