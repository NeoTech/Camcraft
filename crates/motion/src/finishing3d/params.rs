/// so the cusp budget is spent along both directions; Scallop runs
/// it twice along the DIAGONALS - the constant-cusp promise: no
/// linear terrain feature (which in this codebase's prismatic
/// models means none aligned to X or Y) can run parallel to both
/// families, so no feature's cusp escapes a crossing cut. The flat
/// cusp of the crossed pair is the single family's - the kernel
/// measures it, and no analytic sqrt(2) discount is claimed. Radial
/// (M2.2d) sends chords through the shallow terrain's center, one
/// per stepover of arc at the rim; Spiral runs ONE Archimedean
/// curve in from the silhouette - the retract-free continuous cut.
/// Both ride `march_curve`'s laws verbatim - only the placement of
/// the ground lines changes, never what a step promises - and both
/// hand the steep flanks to the same rings. Contour (M2.2e) shrinks
/// the terrain's center-shadow by one stepover per pass - concentric
/// loops, each lifted sample sitting tangent wherever a tangent
/// exists - and Project runs only its boundary: the model's own
/// silhouette, XY kept, Z lifted. Rings close both families.
/// SteepShallow (M2.5 A) is the auto-split spoken as a partition:
/// the raster rides the shallow ground exactly as Parallel does,
/// and the ring ladder keeps its hands OFF shallow tangency - the
/// 45° line stops being a meeting place and becomes a border, so
/// no slope is ridden twice and the flanks answer to their OWN
/// spacing number (`steep_stepover`, the ring ladder's author when
/// stated). Flat (M2.5 A) finishes the floors only: the near-level
/// facets' footprints, shrunk one stepover per pass at constant
/// tip-Z - the shadow family's choreography on the ground the
/// waterline's rest verdict always refused to claim. Pencil and
/// Corner (M2.5 B) are the crease pair: each rides the locus of
/// centers tangent to BOTH faces of a concave edge at once, and the
/// band `p/tan(theta/2)` - the skirt a ball of radius p can never
/// clean - says which of the two speaks: Corner for the tool's own
