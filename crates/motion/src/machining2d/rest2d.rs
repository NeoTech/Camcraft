//! 2D rest machining (#1446): the part of a pocket a larger previous tool
//! could not reach, and the pocket passes that cut only that part.
//!
//! Provenance: the area a cutter of radius R can sweep inside a pocket P
//! is the morphological opening of P by a disc of radius R - erode P by R
//! (the legal cutter centers), then dilate the result by R (what the
//! cutter covers from them); the residue is P minus that opening (J.
//! Serra, "Image Analysis and Mathematical Morphology", Academic Press
//! 1982, for erosion, dilation and opening). In pocket machining the same
//! construction is the inward offset of the boundary followed by an
//! outward one (M. Held, "On the Computational Geometry of Pocket
//! Machining", LNCS 500, Springer 1991), and the material a large cutter
//! leaves for a smaller one is treated that way in D. Veeramani and Y.-S.
//! Gau, "Selection of an optimal set of cutting-tool sizes for 2.5D pocket
//! machining", Computer-Aided Design 29(12), 1997, and Z. Yao, S. K. Gupta
//! and D. S. Nau, "Algorithms for selecting cutters in multi-part milling
//! problems", Computer-Aided Design 35(9), 2003. Written from those and
//! this project's own polygon offsets (`geo2d`); the margins, the film
//! tolerance and every refusal are ours. No other CAM product's code or
//! output was consulted.
//!
//! Prime Directive: the rest area is read large, never small. The cleared
//! area is shrunk by [`REST_MARGIN`] before it is subtracted, a flat
//! width the previous tool's corner radius does not cut is not counted as
//! cleared, and the allowance only grows the area. The one thing dropped
//! is a film thinner than [`REST_FILM`], which is below what the offsets
//! resolve (without it every wall would read as rest material). The
//! passes are the pocket's own: every move below the top of the cut is a
//! feed or a plunge, so a wrong previous tool costs a heavier cut, never
//! a rapid into stock.
