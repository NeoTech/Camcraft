//! The trochoid lane's bore (issues #220, #1509): the helix that takes
//! the tool down to a level at the chain's start, and - for a loop band
//! wider than the tool - the spiral that opens that bore out to the
//! band. Helical entry is general machining practice (handbook ramping);
//! the opening is the two-centre semicircle spiral (successive half
//! turns about two centres half a pitch apart: each ends on the bore's
//! wall axis one half pitch further out), so it posts as G2/G3 arcs and
//! consecutive turns nest without crossing. Its pitch follows the lane's
//! forward step ([`PITCH_PER_STEP`] of it), so the measured-engagement
//! ladder that shortens the step tightens the spiral with it, and the
//! spiral is read by the same measurement as the loops.
//!
//! Why it exists: a helix of radius `b` clears the ring `b +- r` only.
//! With `b > r` a post of radius `b - r` is left standing at the bore's
//! centre, which no front arc ever reaches. The stand-alone slot keeps
//! the plain bore it always posted (`open: false`); the 2D Adaptive
//! trochoidal method asks for the opened one. Ours, no vendor material.
