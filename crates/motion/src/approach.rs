//! The entry, lead and engagement parameters of a level ladder (M11.3
//! B/C/D): how each entry motion is shaped (ramp angle and leg length,
//! ramp per level or from the top of the cut; helix radius range, pitch
//! or angle, direction; arc radius and sweep; plunge feed height), the
//! contour's lead geometry (lead-out shape, extensions, vertical lead-in
//! height, overlap, an axis-aligned lead start), and the feeds and the
//! engagement limit at entry. Every field's zero / default is the
//! pre-M11.3 behaviour, so a default `Approach` posts today's moves byte
//! for byte.
//!
//! Provenance: the standard entry/lead parameter vocabulary of published
//! CAM practice and machining handbooks (ramp angle and length, helical
//! entry radius and pitch, tangent-arc and linear leads with extensions,
//! closed-contour overlap, reduced entry feeds); the feed-vs-engagement
//! law is the material-removal-rate reading of radial engagement (MRR
//! ~ ae * vf, held at the limit's value) on top of the M2.1 / M11.4
//! engagement geometry. Our own model; no vendor material consulted.
