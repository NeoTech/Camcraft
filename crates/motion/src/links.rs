//! Level transitions and links (M11.2 C/D): how a multi-level ladder
//! descends from one cut level to the next, and how it travels between
//! levels and between the passes of one level - every choice the user's.
//!
//! Provenance: the standard multi-depth transitions and link strategies
//! of published CAM practice and machining handbooks - plunge, linear
//! ramp at a maximum angle (zig-zag along the cut), helical
//! interpolation at a pitch, circular ramp in the vertical plane; links
//! that retract to the clearance plane, retract to the retract plane, or
//! stay down at feed within a maximum distance where the link is in
//! cleared air. RS-274 / ISO 6983 linear and circular interpolation. The
//! laws (what proves a keep-down link, what is named when it lifts) are
//! ours; no vendor material consulted (Clean-Room Protocol).
