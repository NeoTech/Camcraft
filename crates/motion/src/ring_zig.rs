//! The ring ramp (#1558): a planned zig-zag ramp flown as helical arcs
//! about a ring's centre instead of its polygon's chords - only where
//! the planned prefix provably lies on that ring, in the ring's own
//! sense, and every arc spans a chord no posted resolution can collapse.
//! Anything else posts the chords ([`push_zig`]), as before #1558.
//!
//! Provenance: our own law over RS-274 / ISO 6983 circular
//! interpolation (G2/G3 with a Z word is a helix); the full-circle
//! reading of an arc whose endpoints coincide is the standard's own
//! (a G2/G3 whose end equals its start is one whole turn). No vendor
//! material consulted (Clean-Room Protocol).
