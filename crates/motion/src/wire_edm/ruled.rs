//! Wire EDM 4-axis contour (#537, part of #290): a closed upper profile
//! on the top plane and a closed lower profile on the lower programmed
//! plane, given separately and paired into rulings. Per D2 each move
//! ends on the lower plane at a ruling's lower point and its pose is
//! the wire toward the ruling's upper point; between two moves both
//! ends interpolate - the ruled surface.
//!
//! The pairing rule is stated, never guessed (`pairing`): by normalised
//! arc length from each profile's point nearest the start hole, or by
//! sync points - pairs of one point on each profile - with normalised
//! arc length between them. The rule lays the stated surface over the
//! two profiles as given, and the wire's own surface over their
//! parallels at the kerf offset.
//!
//! A straight wire cannot touch a twisted ruled surface along its whole
//! height (`ruled_laws`): where the two profiles turn against each
//! other the wire's section between the planes stands nearer the
//! surface than the offset on the planes. The generator never lets the
//! kerf in: it widens the offset on both planes, uniformly, until the
//! ruled kerf law holds at every height read, and says how much stands
//! on the profile planes for it. More than the stated tolerance is
//! refused by name.
//!
//! Refused by name, never trimmed: an open profile or profiles of
//! different kinds, sync points that are unpaired, off their profile,
//! doubled or crossed, a folding or self-crossing pairing, a ruling
//! past the machine's maximum taper, a twist past the tolerance, and
//! every refusal of the vertical cut on either plane. The upper guide's
//! U/V stroke and the guides' reach are the machine check's (#536).
//!
//! Provenance: see `pairing` and `ruled_laws` (public CAGD and
//! differential-geometry texts), over the umbrella's decisions D2 and
//! D7 and #536's pose and kerf readings. Our own code; no vendor post,
//! control manual or CAM product behaviour was consulted.
