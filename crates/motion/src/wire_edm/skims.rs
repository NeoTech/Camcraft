//! Wire EDM skim passes (#538, part of #290): after the rough pass,
//! each skim walks the same profile again at its own condition's
//! offset (wire radius + that condition's spark gap), from the same
//! threading point, optionally in the other direction. The passes'
//! offsets step toward the profile: no pass may stand nearer the
//! profile than the finishing (last) pass - it would cut past the
//! finished profile - and none may stand farther out than the pass
//! before it, where it would cut only air. One threading cuts every
//! pass, so every skim's condition must state the rough pass's wire.
//!
//! Provenance: general wire EDM practice (a rough cut followed by
//! skim cuts at decreasing offsets, the finishing pass setting the
//! size), as the public EDM literature #290 cites describes it; our
//! own code over the module's single-pass generator. No vendor
//! manual, condition table or CAM product behaviour was consulted.
