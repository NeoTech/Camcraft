//! What the machine does once an operation is done (issue #110): carry
//! on, an optional stop, a program stop, or a trip home. Provenance:
//! the RS-274 / ISO 6983 miscellaneous functions M0 (program stop) and
//! M1 (optional stop) and the reference-return idea of public control
//! programming manuals; our own names and stream spelling, no vendor
//! material.
//!
//! The stream law, the coolant's twin: carrying on is what a section
//! states by saying nothing - every stream written before the choice
//! existed posts exactly as it always did. Any other choice rides one
//! `PARAM AfterOperation <word>` ahead of the section; the post writes
//! its dialect's words after the section's spindle stop, and a dialect
//! that cannot honor the choice refuses by name.
