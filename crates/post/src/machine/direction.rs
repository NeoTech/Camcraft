//! Per-axis direction (#373): a machine whose linear axis moves the
//! other way for a positive command.
//!
//! Provenance: ISO 841 / RS-274 name the right-handed program frame the
//! whole CAM side keeps (generation, verification and the stock sim never
//! change); a machine-tool handbook's axis-direction note is the source
//! for "this slide's + goes the other way". The grammar (`"direction": +1
//! | -1` on a linear part of the `.mch` file) and every name here are ours.
//!
//! The law: the machine file states WHICH axis is inverted; the program
//! frame stays standard. A stated travel is the machine's own stroke - in
//! the coordinates its controller reads - so an inverted axis maps it
//! into the program frame by negation ([`AxisLimits::program_travel`]).
//! The post translates an inverted X / Y into the controller's frame
//! (#374, `post::invert`); what it cannot translate - an inverted Z, any
//! other letter - is refused by name ([`Machine::inverted_post_refusal`]):
//! a standard-sign program on it would move the slide the wrong way.
