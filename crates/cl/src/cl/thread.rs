//! The threading intent record (issue #34): what a thread's cycle is,
//! standing beside the explicit helical passes that cut it.
//!
//! Provenance: the quantities a lathe control's multi-pass threading
//! cycle asks for - start and end of the thread, major / minor
//! diameter, lead, thread height, first-pass and minimum depth, finish
//! allowance, infeed angle, spring passes, pull-out - as public lathe
//! programming references and machine-tool handbooks list them
//! (behaviour only). Our own model; no vendor material consulted. The
//! explicit passes remain the truth for verification, display and
//! simulation (the drilling `Cycle` law); the record is what a post
//! with a threading cycle writes in their place.
