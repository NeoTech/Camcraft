//! The move vocabulary: kinds, the lattice, arcs and their chords.
//!
//! Provenance: Move kinds map to the G0/G1 vocabulary of ISO 6983 /
//! RS-274 (public standards); the rapid/feed/plunge split is general
//! machining practice. Arc moves carry the exact circular segment
//! (center + direction); the arc is geometry, the kind stays the
//! motion class. Chord flattening - for verification, display and the
//! golden dump - is [`Move::chords`], the one sagitta law for the
//! whole codebase. Arcs turn in XY; M2.1 (helical entries) widened
//! the law so an arc's endpoints may differ in Z - a Z change along
//! an XY circle is a helix, which the timeline (`sim::path_len`,
//! exact arc length over Z) and the post (`G2/G3` blocks carry the Z
//! word) already read. Endpoints whose XY coincides are never an arc:
//! that is a plunge, and straight it stays. M11.2 A gave the arc its
//! plane ([`ArcPlane`]: XY / XZ / YZ, G17 / G18 / G19) - the
//! convention, direction rule and worked examples live in
//! [`super::plane`]; an XY arc is exactly the arc it always was.
