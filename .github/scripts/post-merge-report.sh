#!/usr/bin/env bash
# post-merge.yml's reporting (#1451): one rolling issue "main is red
# (post-merge gate)". Red: open it, or comment on the open one, with the
# failing suites, the head sha and the run URL. Green: comment the green sha
# and close it. Never one issue per run.
# Inputs (env): STATUS (success|failure), SHA, RUN_URL, REPO, OUTPUT (the
# gate's stdout file), GH (gh binary override, tests use a fake).
# Priority (AGENTS.md "Priorities", P1..P9): a red gate on main is P2; it is
# P1 (wrong output) only when a failing suite is one of OUTPUT_SUITES below,
# the suites whose job is to compare posted NC or CL output with a golden or
# recorded stream. A compile error, a lathe/sim/motion law or a post-crate
# unit (lib) test stays P2. An open P2 issue is raised to P1 when a later run
# fails an output suite; it is never lowered here (a human does that).
# Provenance: our own AGENTS.md "Issue Law"; GitHub's public gh CLI docs.
