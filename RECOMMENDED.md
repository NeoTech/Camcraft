Format per entry: **what was decided**, **why**, **what it'd cost to change
later**. Newest milestone first.

## M4.1 - The crate split, rung by rung (commits 43745cb..415dd85 + this docs)

**New crates are `camcraft-*`; existing binary crates keep their names for
now.** `hsmworks-app`/`hsmworks-ui` ride until the M4.3 debrand renames
them; the six new crates had no legacy brand debt, so they shipped as
camcraft-geometry/cl/tools/post/sim/motion directly. Cost to change: one
Cargo.toml pass + import sweep, same work M4.3 owes anyway.

**post.exe lives in camcraft-post.** It is the post engine's binary; R3
moved it there with its bin name unchanged (`post`), so the packaging
script keeps finding it without a hardcoded app path (re-verified at
close-out: `post 0.3.0 (boa_engine)`).

**R0 was a fifth relocation, not a no-op rung.** Type homes moved inside
app first (doc note listed four; a fifth - sim's Traverse - emerged when
stock_sim split). Logged so the graph and the docs agree.

**The release-offset subtask ran at close-out, not per rung.** ROADMAP's
"with every gate passed where a feature has been set" was read as the
milestone (a feature ship-unit), not each refactor commit: a
`cargo build --release` after every rung would have re-compiled the same
tree six times. It ran once at M4.1 close-out and passed (one transient
flecs_ecs_sys gcc build-script failure under the backgrounded run -
rerun clean; worth noting as CI flake if it recurs).

**Deviation register (R1-R4), all deliberate:**
- R4 left `rest.rs` in app - it is re-machining orchestration (walks the
  world, reads stamps), not a generator; the motion crate owns the
  physics, app keeps the choreography.
- R4 sank the islands law `material_above` to
  `geometry::slice::material_above` - it reads a mesh, nothing above the
  geometry layer; three readers (machining3d wrapper, sim verify,
  app stock-sim path) share one law at the lowest honest home.
- R4 put solid-rest's engine in camcraft-sim, not motion - rest queries
  are material accounting (dexel grid), motion only consumes them; the
  motion→sim dependency is exactly that edge.
- R5's 400-line rule landed as "split along section seams"; six files
  still exceed 400 (see ledger) - the alternative was mid-function cuts
  that break the "one concern per file" honesty.

**R5 400-line backlog ledger** (line counts at the split; each gets cut
again the next time it is touched, no dedicated sweep):
operation/generate.rs 481, project/params_impl.rs 499, project/params.rs
463, operation/selection.rs 416, operation/stitch.rs 413,
operation/types.rs 808 (pre-dates R5: the component/type registry -
splitting it means splitting schema.rs's twin, hold for M4.3's naming
pass). machining2d.rs 2299, finishing3d.rs 1579, feature.rs 1545,
stock_sim.rs (world half) 1240, drilling.rs 1024, machining3d.rs 915,
verify.rs 905 live in crates now and carry the same debt per crate.

**Graphify:** R5's file moves were many enough for a full rebuild. The
plain rebuild tripped both export guards - the #479 shrink guard (the
cache re-mints doc nodes sparsely, 3477 raw < 4318 saved) and the
semantic-loss guard (849 saved doc ids). Resolved per the
doc-node-guard recipe: fold saved ∪ new with every saved-origin doc
node restored (saved wins the id on label duplicates) - no `--force`,
nothing content-lost. Residual: the restored edges that pointed at
legacy `_rs_`-format sourceless ghosts are dangling in the raw sidecar
(310) and dropped by the builder - zero in the final graph. Final:
4397 nodes / 11501 edges / 221 communities, old names carried by
member-overlap vote.

## M4.4 - Test cost shape

**The verdict lane is `#[ignore]`, not a second binary.** ROADMAP offered
either; ignore-in-place keeps every fixture, helper and golden assert in
one file (finish3d's law tests share `dome()`/`cone()` builders with its
verdicts — a split binary would duplicate them or reach across `mod`).
The reason string names the lane and the command, so `cargo test
-- --ignored --list` is self-documenting. *Cost to change:* a separate
`--test` binary later is a cut-paste of the marked blocks; nothing
structural prefers one over the other.

**Six LAW-shaped tests joined the heavy lane.** `a_hop_plane...`,
`climb_and_conventional...`, `the_generator_is_deterministic`,
`levels_snap...`, `rings_close...` and `a_chain_too_long...` assert
generation STRUCTURE (ring counts, link classes, determinism) but ride
the 12×96 dome because their expected counts are that fixture's numbers -
10 to 52 s each at debug speed with no envelope scan at all. Shrinking
their fixture would mean re-deriving every hardcoded count - a rewrite
with silent-weakening risk, which the Prime Directive outranks. They run
in the release lane instead; M4.1's suite move is the honest moment to
give them small-fixture twins. *Cost to change:* the twin work, whenever
the geometry module lands in its own crate.

**Coverage arithmetic is the law, not a nicety:** 39 `#[test]`s before,
39 after (27 ignored); verify.rs 17 → 17 (2 ignored, each a 150 s
`cone_facets(96)` envelope - the whole suite's 155 s was those two). The
default debug ladder is finish3d 0.8 s + verify 0.9 s + the ~5 s field,
against the ROADMAP's 5-min budget. *Cost to change:* none.

**Measured, this run:** heavy lane in release - finish3d 27 verdicts in
202 s (the same set ground ~30 min in debug; "an hour of debug grind is
minutes optimized" holds at 9x), verify's two envelope verdicts in 22 s.
Default debug ladder: finish3d 0.8 s, verify 0.9 s, the rest of the
ladder unchanged - comfortably under the 5-min budget.

**CI grew the release-lane step rather than losing the verdicts.** A
plain `cargo test` silently skips `#[ignore]`d tests forever - the split
would have DELETED coverage on every non-local gate. The one
`cargo test --release -p hsmworks-app -- --ignored` step (after App
tests, before UI) keeps every verdict enforced pre-push. It pays a
release compile of the app crate; that's the price of an honest opt-in
lane, and rust-cache amortizes it. *Cost to change:* dropping the step
trades measured-clean guarantees for CI minutes - a bad trade, flag it
if CI time ever forces it.

**No release build is owed for M4.4.** The standing order offsets a
release at each gated feature milestone; M4.4 moved no `src` line (test
annotations, docs, CI only), so the v0.3.0 binary is still the current
hand-test vehicle and shipping a byte-identical 0.3.x would be ceremony.
The next release offset lands on the Phase-4 milestone that first moves
src - which the ordering below makes M4.1. *Cost to change:* none; the
ladder simply picks up at the next milestone tag.

## M3.3 close-out - the 0.3.0 release and the Phase-4 ordering

**Shipped 0.3.0 on the M3.3 D commit.** Cargo version + RELEASE_NOTES
rewritten "what's new since 0.2.0", persistence quoted v19→v23, annotated
tag `v0.3.0` on the lock-sync commit, docs tag `m3.3-done`. PROJECT_VERSION
23 stayed the file-format number - the two "versions" are different clocks
and the notes say so in different words. *Cost to change:* none - the
release train is the same one 0.1.0 and 0.2.0 rode.

**Phase 4 runs M4.4 FIRST, before the M4.1 subcrate split.** The roadmap
lists them in numeric order, but M4.4 (test cost shape) is the one that
pays every later milestone: finish3d's ~30-min tail taxes each close-out
gate, and M4.1's split would move those tests twice - once to split them,
once to fix their paths. The law/verdict split + `#[ignore]` heavy lane +
diff-targeted gating lands first, then the crates move under tests that
already run in seconds. *Cost to change:* resequencing is free until
either one lands; after M4.1 it costs a re-split.

**Gate note for the close-out itself:** all 30 app suites green in two
parallel waves (32-core box, no cargo lock on direct binary runs), all 8
UI suites green serially from `crates/ui` (the snapshot goldens resolve
CWD-relative - a "Missing snapshot" panic is the cwd, not a regression),
clippy clean, the 13+57 `.nc` goldens byte-identical. The full-suite pass
here is the milestone close-out AGENTS.md allows, not a new habit.

**graphify --update at close-out hit the semantic-loss guard and was
resolved by hand** (fold saved∪new per file, `dedup=False` - the fuzzy
fold retires guard-required ids by collapsing pre-existing twin nodes).
A `--update` on this repo should keep `dedup=False` until the guard and
dedup agree; the TODO.md re-queue from the unverified-shrink flag is
expected and will force-clean on its own next run.

## M3.3 D - RTCP output and the block trace (this commit)

**The post delegates the pivot math to the controller.** The stream's
A/B/C words are absolute commanded angles in the tool-tip frame; the
Fanuc post emits them verbatim under `G43.4` and never rotates a
vector itself. Why: RTCP is precisely the function the control
implements — a post doing its own kinematics would double-transform
the moment the control's setting disagrees with ours. The refusal
that blocks a tilted stream on a non-RTCP machine is the same law
seen from the other side: without the mode, the same XYZ cuts
different metal, so reinterpretation is the silent gouge. *Cost to
change:* a future offline-RTCP mode (posts that compute tip paths for
controls WITHOUT G43.4) would add a geometry helper to the driver
side and a new machine capability word; nothing in the format blocks
it.

**`machine.rtcp` is a geometric judgment, not a naming one.** The
script's boolean is true when some rotary states a direction whose Z
component is not dominant - an A about X tilts, a C about Z spins in
plane. A rotary that states no direction tilts nothing a post may
promise (silence stays silence through the mirror AND the raw file
door). This is stage C's promise kept ("stage D adds the rotary
mirror honestly"): rotaries ride their own `kinematics.static.rotaries`
section - letter, direction, travel - and their deg/min rates enter
NO prismatic field; the ceiling folds now filter rotaries out,
closing the latent leak where a 9000 deg/min table out-rated a 7000
mm/min slide into `rapidRate`. *Cost to change:* none - the shape is
what the posts read.

**The modal angle law runs in both directions, and the arm is the
memory reset.** After `G43.4`, the first tilted block states all three
letters (the control's modal memory starts blank); afterwards only
the letters whose commanded value CHANGED ride the block - including
on the home return, where a zero that others already carry stays
silent. A tool change (G49 cancels TCPM) re-arms: the next tilted
move re-commands all three even when the angles repeat. *Cost to
change:* the dedup table is three scalars in the script's preamble.

**Angles ride the stream, never the CL goldens.** `MoveRec.abc` is
`Option`; every in-app dump of a prismatic toolpath writes `None`
(zero bytes of change to the 13 committed `.nc` goldens - they were
byte-compared after this whole seam). The `.cl` legacy dialect has no
angle words by law; only the v1 `A <i> B <i> C <i>` keyed form speaks
tilt. *Cost to change:* none; the parser's all-three-or-none law
means a half-stated tilt never enters silently.

**The trace derives, it does not store.** The viewer's trace pane has
no selection field: the highlighted block is the one owning the
scroll cursor the window already publishes, and clicking a block
centers its first line through the row's own `scroll_to_me` - the
next frame's cursor law reads the selection back. A swallowed record
appears in `blocks` with an empty range and "(no output)"; a record
that legitimately writes nothing (a stored PARAM, a TOOL whose words
the post prints in the section preamble) gets no block - the trace
reads as the program, not as the stream echoed back. *Cost to
change:* storing a selection would need a second cursor law to agree
with the first; the derived one cannot disagree.

**`sim.rs` did not change, and that is the tested claim.**
`Traverse::from_machine` only ever receives the mirror (rotary-free
by construction, the filter above is the guarantee) or the raw
default VMC (no rotaries stated). A tilted-motion TIMING model would
need the sim to understand TCP - M5's machine-sim territory, not
output. The machine/operations tests pin that the walk stays the
post's walk. *Cost to change:* none pending.

## M3.3 C - Declared kind, full numbers, coolant codes, changer capacity, machine editor

**The kind is stored as the file's WORD, and declared outranks
inferred.** `Machine.kind` is `Option<String>`, not the enum: a project
file round-trips exactly what was written, and `is_sane` is the single
place that decides what is statable (an unreadable word refuses at
`parse_mch`, so no mounted machine can carry one). When the declaration
and the axis inventory disagree, the declaration wins - "the file
knows parts the kinematics tree hides" - which is the discussion-worthy
half: a mistyped `kind: "lathe"` on a real VMC darkens the mill cells
with nothing to contradict it except the axis table a row below.
*Cost to change:* the word is the persistence shape; normalizing to
the enum at parse is a one-line switch that would start rewriting
files.

**Stage C fixed a law M3.2 E could never reach.** The mill-turn
inference tested for A/B/C names, but the parser collected only
`"type": "linear"` parts - a real file's rotary never entered the
inventory, so MillTurn was unreachable outside hand-built structs.
Rotary parts now join, with a stated `rotary: bool` (a linear axis
named A is a slide; a rotary named Q still turns) and the letter test
kept as the legacy fallback. Rotary numbers never ride the inch→mm
factor - a deg/min scaled as mm/min is a unit lie, so scaling is
per-part. The same unit law is why rotary axes stay out of the post
mirror's prismatic axis list: the CPS contract has no rotary word, and
staging D/RTCP will add one honestly rather than slip degrees into a
millimeters field. *Cost to change:* none pending; stage D owns the
rotary mirror section.

**No version bump, on the skip-if-unstated promise.** Every new field
(`kind`, `spindle_power`, `tool_count`, `coolants`, per-axis
`rotary`/`resolution`) is `skip_serializing_if`-gated: a pre-stage-C
project saves byte-identically and loads unchanged, and the roundtrip
test pins that an unstated machine MINTS none of the new keys. Coolants
reaching the post completes stage A's sentence through the same mirror
(a `toolStation.coolants` the mounted struct grew), so the editor's
Apply and the file mount take one road - `machine_value` re-mirrors
the live struct and there is no stale-raw seam to rot. A name-only
entry rides codeless and posts nothing: visible on the sheet, silent
in the program. *Cost to change:* a bump only if a field ever needs a
different spelling than its Rust name.

**The machine editor is the tool editor's draft law, and Apply is
plain `LoadMachine`.** The window edits a COPY (ephemeral,
never-saved, never-undoable); Apply mounts through the SAME command a
file-load uses, at the SAME path (`built-in: {name}` for the library,
via one shared format function so "loaded from" never quotes a file
that does not exist), and undo restores the exact previous numbers. No
new command type. A refused Apply keeps the window open - the draft is
someone's work, and discarding it silently is the silent wrong answer
wearing a dialog. The built-in machines are named in the pane but are
NOT a stored reference: mounting stores the parsed machine itself, so
editing a VMC never edits the shipped file. *Cost to change:* an
`EditMachine` command type would only exist to remember what the
History already knows.

**Two numbers stated, deliberately not judged.** Spindle power checks
nothing yet - the consumption model that could violate it belongs to
the tool library's per-material speeds/feeds work, and checking
against nothing is a false green. Changer capacity counts DISTINCT
tool NAMES across the program, not tool changes: a 12-slot drum running
13 changes of 1 tool is fine, and the checker says so by silence. The
three library files (VMC, Mill-turn, Lathe - all original, checker
grammar) are pinned by a test that reads each both ways: declared kind
equals inferred kind. *Cost to change:* power's verdict lands with the
speeds/feeds model; nothing to unwind first.

## M3.3 B - Five built-in posts, by-name registry, conformance goldens (this commit)

**Built-ins are addressed by name; the stage-A flag is closed.**
`PostRef` gained `Named(String)` exactly where stage A said stage B
would: a persisted *index* into an array that grows would make every
existing file's meaning shift under a re-order, a name cannot. Entry 0
remains Fanuc forever (`Builtin` still means it — every pre-B project
posts Fanuc, unchanged), and the Setup-pane combo resolves names to
rows at draw time; the row index is screen furniture, the document
stores the name. An unknown name (a project from a future build with
more posts) refuses at `SelectPost` creation and displays as
"(built-in, missing)" — never a silent swap to Fanuc. *Cost to
change:* none — the name is the persistence contract.

**`PostDto` is a tagged enum, not one ambiguous string.** v23's `post`
key now serializes `{"named": "Haas"}` or `{"file": "C:\\...x.cps"}`
(serde externally-tagged; `Builtin` = absent = None). A single string
field could not honestly distinguish `Haas` the name from a file
called `Haas`, and the value domain of v23 widened mid-version because
v23 has never shipped to a user — the bump already belongs to M3.3,
and pre-release formats get to firm up inside their own version. *Cost
to change:* a v24 bump if a released build ever needs a different shape.

**Where public convention is silent, house style decided, and the
goldens lock it.** `%` fence: Fanuc/Haas/Mazak yes, Sinumerik/Heidenhain
no. Line numbers: Sinumerik only (N10 steps). Motion words: 2-digit
(Fanuc, Mazak) vs 1-digit (Haas, Sinumerik DIN, Heidenhain DIN). Tool
word: `T02 M6` + `G43 H02` (Fanuc), plain `T2 M6` + `G43 H2` (Haas,
Mazak), `T2 D2 M6` no G43 (Sinumerik — DIN tool offsets own length),
`T2 M6` no length word (Heidenhain DIN). Retract mode: `G98` once +
modal bare-X Y continuation (Fanuc, Haas, Mazak) vs every hole fully
restated, no G98 word (Sinumerik, Heidenhain). Spindle: `S.. M3` vs
Mazak's `MOTON S..`/`MOTOFF`. Peck: G73 (fast) / G83 (full-retract);
Mazak G73 rides its own dialect. Each `.cps` header cites the public
standard its choices follow and names the house-style spots as ours.

**Heidenhain ships as DIN/ISO, not native KL.** The KL/TCL cycle
language (`CALL CYCLE(…)`) is a proprietary-grammar dialect we can
only reimplement from documentation fragments; DIN/ISO is the same
control's RS-244-class mode, fully public. The conformance law needs
scripts we can defend line by line. A KL-mode post is a legitimate
future registry entry — the by-name registry grows without disturbing
any saved project. *Cost to change:* one more BUILTINS row.

**The synthesized stream exists because the legacy goldens were
motion-only.** Every `.cl` golden predates params and tool blocks, so
no committed program ever contained an `S.. M3`, a `T.. M6` or a
dwelled `G82` — the exact words the five dialects disagree on.
`conformance.rs` posts one hand-built v1 stream (params, tool, contour,
five hole cycles) through all five scripts into `nc/synth_<stem>.nc`.
Its cycles anchor (`AT n`) on the opening rapid of their own hole
chain — the shape a real generator dump has. Anchor them at move 0
and `normalize_program_order` re-seats the group ahead of the
contour, whose moves then die in the chain-suppression guard
(`if (inCycle) return`) — 0 swallowed, silently absent. A synthetic
stream must be shaped like a real one; the law is now in the test's
own doc comment. *Cost to change:* regenerating `WRITE_GOLDEN=1`
reads the diff like every other golden.

**One latent, repo-wide, pre-existing eol hazard (not introduced
here, found by the commit warnings).** The goldens are LF in the
object store and `core.autocrlf` converts them to CRLF at checkout —
but the engine emits LF and the tests compare byte-exact, so a
*fresh clone* would fail every golden until someone normalizes. This
tree has never re-checked-out those files, so it has never bitten.
The one-line fix is a `.gitattributes` (`*.nc *.cl *.cps text eol=lf`
or a global `* text=auto eol=lf` decision); it touches every file
stat, so it belongs to a discussion, not a feature commit.

## M3.3 A - Post selection, mounted-machine output, user .cps posts

**The mounted machine reaches the post as a mirror, not as raw JSON.**
The plan carried a "raw rides the mount" design (store the `.mch` file's
JSON verbatim beside the parsed `Machine` and hand it to the post). What
shipped instead is `post::machine::mirror(&Machine) -> Value`: the
checker grammar (`parts`, `controller`, travel `ext`) is bridged to the
static post grammar (`kinematics.static.axes[].speeds`,
`head.spindle.max`, `coolants`) at the one call site. *Why:* one source
of truth — the parsed machine every other consumer (collision, traverse
timing) already reads, so the post can never disagree with the sim; and
mirror states only what the file stated — an unstated limit is absent,
never a zero that lies (a mounted machine naming no coolants posts no
M8, proven in `posting.rs`). Raw storage would have doubled the machine
representation and the persistence surface for no behavior the mirror
doesn't give. *Cost to change:* additive — a `raw` field on `Machine`
(serde-skipped) plus a DTO key, if a future post ever needs a grammar
the checker drops.

**`PostRef::Builtin` carries no index; built-ins are named, chosen by
position.** The enum is `Builtin | File(path)` — Builtin means
`BUILTINS[0]`. *Why:* stage A ships one built-in, and persisting an
index into an array that stage B grows to five would make every v23
file's meaning shift under a re-order. Stage B must either keep index
0 == Fanuc forever or add the index variant at the same version bump —
flagging this now is the cheap part. *Cost to change:* one migration
arm if the variant comes late.

**Project format v23: one additive top-level `post` key.** No machine
DTO change (the mirror decision above made the planned `raw` key
unnecessary), so the only new fact is the post choice: `None` =
built-in, `Some(path)` = user file; a v22 file steps up unchanged and
means the built-in. `open()` lands the singleton either way — the
leak-guard law (every field is reset on open, so a stale choice can't
ride into a fresh document). *Cost to change:* none, it's the pattern.

**The picker lives in the Setup pane, not the toolbar.** The toolbar is
a static command enum (no dynamic menus by design), so the post row
sits beside the machine row: label + "Load post (.cps)" + "Built-in".
The toolbar's single Post button still posts with whatever the document
names — one truth, no hidden choice.

**onComment is honored only where the stream carries data.** `Record::Warn`
now calls the hook; `onRadiusCompensation` stays silent because no CL
record carries comp — that waits for G41/G42 path support (M1.3's open
flag). The Warn echo can only ever appear in a REFUSED program: the
same warning count that grows the list blocks the write, so the 13 .nc
goldens are byte-identical (gate-verified) and no released program
gained a comment.

**Rotary axes are excluded from the mirror in stage A.** The checker's
`AxisLimits` carries no direction vector to map, so a rotary axis would
mirror as a lie; stage D (RTCP) brings the real geometry and the mirror
grows then. Trunnion/tilting definitions arrive with M3.3 C's machine
kinds.

## M3.2 B-E - Fixtures, tool lists, sheets, workspaces (this commit)

**A fixture is a model wearing a marker, and the marker is the whole
state.** Stage B's first draft grew a parametric `FixtureKind` enum with
synthetic vise/chuck geometry. The re-spec during the stage settled it
the other way: the shop's real workholding is a solid - a STEP file the
user loads - so a fixture is any model entity wearing
`FixtureDef { setup: Option<String> }`, positioned by the same
`Location` a part uses, and the only geometry law is the one the
collision check always had: facets in world space.

- **The user brings the fixture; the machine file brings the machine.**
  The preloaded "fixtures" are the spindle band (from the `.mch`'s
  `spindle body_diameter`/`body_length`, a cylinder past the holder) and
  the table (`Machine/Table` - a derived prose row, never an entity: it
  exists while the `.mch` says travel does, and its underside is
  unbounded by MAX_FIXTURE_DIM). No synthetic vises ship with the app;
  vises and clamps are the user's solids. Cost to revisit: parametric
  presets would be a content decision (a bundled fixture library), not
  a data-model one - the marker already carries the binding.
- **The collision gate is cheap-by-construction, and workholding never
  rides the stamp.** Verify takes `fixtures: &[FixtureBox]` +
  `spindle: Option<(r, len)>` and runs its stack test (shank → holder →
  spindle, then the flute column itself, first-hit-wins per move, every
  cylinder SWEPT along the move's xy path rather than sampled at its
  endpoints, rapids against every box with no
  vertical exemption) only when the list is non-empty - a document
  without workholding runs byte-identical pre-M3.2B checks. The laws
  were first wired into `GenStamp` as a digest term; the UI's own M2.3
  tests caught the contradiction ("load the roomy machine and the same
  program posts without re-generating" cannot coexist with a stamp that
  churns on machine load), and the Prime Directive's other half is
  served by the fix, not weakened by it: the post's LIVE `verification_
  gate` re-runs the region-free band laws (`verify::bands_vs_fixtures`,
  `verify::rapids_vs_fixtures`) against the cached paths and the steel
  as it stands now. A moved vise cannot silently post - the gate names
  the op, move, and struck element - and no fixture or machine action
  can stale a fresh toolpath. Evidence is computed here and now, never
  a cached verdict: the M2.3 machine-limits law, extended to clamping.
- **Two laws stage B's own acceptance test fixed, not review.** The
  moved-vise gate test went red the week the code went in, and it was
  right twice over - the Prime Directive working as designed, a silent
  wrong answer caught by a test rather than on the shop floor. (1) The
  workpiece sim counted fixture-tagged models as PART geometry: a vise
  box read as material the paths promised to leave standing, so a face
  near the jaws reported phantom gouging. Fixtures joined the stock
  exclusion clause - setup furniture, never design intent. (2) The band
  law sampled each cylinder at a move's law points, so an 8 mm jaw
  standing between two far endpoints could be read straight past, clean
  and silent. Bands now sweep the cylinder along the move's xy trace -
  one segment for a straight, chords for an arc (`fixture::
  band_hits_box`, z rule from the stack law, xy rule from the rapid
  law) - a strict superset of the point test, so every verdict made
  before it stands. Both halves keep the module's err-toward-HIT law,
  with its one stated err toward silence (flush z contact within
  FIXTURE_HIT_TOL is contact, not crash) untouched.
- **The struck element is named for what is at that z.** The flute
  column fallback reported its hits as "shank" - a shop-facing lie,
  since the shank stands above the flutes and a flute-in-vise means the
  endmill itself is milling the clamping steel. `FixturePart::Flute` is
  a new variant (additive: the existing names stay the file-format
  contract) and the fallback reports the flute as itself.
- **The tree marks workholding, and the mark is marker-driven.** A
  fixture model's browser row carries the vise glyph (original drawing,
  `assets/ui/fixture.png`, in the icons module's own hand-drawn family)
  and " (fixture)" in the suffix column ahead of " (hidden)"; it keeps
  the eye, because a parked vise is still hideable. `panes::
  model_row_marks` is the pure mapping - no geometry is relabeled by
  name matching anywhere in the shell.

- **A fixture-bound `DeleteFixture` undoes whole.** Marker, placement,
  and facets are snapshotted at construction and replayed verbatim,
  like every other deletion command; `DeleteEntity` learned to keep the
  marker through undo/redo the same way.
- **Import-as-fixture is two undo units.** The STEP parse stays on the
  worker (no command constructor reads disk in the UI); when the model
  lands, a `TagFixture` bound to the then-active setup executes behind
  it. Undo trades the marker back first, the solid second. A single
  fused command would have meant either a world-reading constructor or
  a headless-only path - the seam is cheaper than either.

**Stage C's tool list is a pure read, in change order, with two stated
constants.** `tool_list::for_setup` walks the program order of one setup
context and emits one `ToolRow` per tool the spindle actually holds:
operations, cut/rapid travel, minutes, change count. `RAPID_MM_S = 100`
and `TOOL_CHANGE_S = 20` are the shop's defaults, documented in the
module - not yet machine-file numbers, because the `.mch` rapids are
per-axis ceilings and converting them to a travel-time law would invent
acceleration data the file does not carry. Cost to revisit: the machine
file growing an explicit rapid-rate-for-time (G0 feed) field, then this
reads it; until then one honest constant.

**Stage D's sheet is a view, not a document.** `setup_sheet::render`
resolves everything live (heights, stock, offsets, fixtures, the stage-C
tool list), prints NO timestamps (the same file renders byte-identical
- the determinism law the goldens already keep), and one setup per
call; the UI's export writes all setups as one .txt with form feeds
(`\u{0c}`) between pages - one file per job instead of one per setup,
because a job's paperwork travels together. The dialog runs no command:
export changes nothing about the document, so the history must not
grow a "undo the export" absurdity.

**Stage E gates the ribbon on an axis-inventory inference, not a new
file format.** `machine::kind` reads the axes the `.mch` already
declares: Y → mill, Y+rotary → mill-turn, X/Z-without-Y → lathe,
anything undecided → mill (what every assumption in this codebase
already is). A lathe document darkens every mill `Create` cell with a
tip that says why - the honest workspace, not a lathe operation set we
cannot generate until M4.2. M3.3's "machine declares its kind" can
replace this inference with a stated field; the ribbon already reads
through the one function.

**Verification found the stage-A commit's one red test - logged
honestly.** `stock_sim_document::missing_pieces_refuse_by_name` asserted
the literal `"no stock defined"`, but 33f5658's own `setup::
stock_entity_name` rewording had made the refusal name WHICH stock
(`no stock 'Stock' - ...`). The refusal was correct; only the test's
earlier literal was stale, and stage A shipped with it red because the
serial 30-40-minute ladder's aggregate RC buried which check moved. The
assert now tests the LAW phrase (`no stock` + `judges material`), not
the setup's name - the name is a fixture, the law is the claim. The
sim≡post gate equality assert in the same test still proves both voices
come from one construction.

**The gate method changed mid-milestone, at the user's call: targeted
parallel binaries, `test result:` lines as truth - not re-ladders.**
Build once (`cargo test -p ... --no-run`), run the individual
`target\debug\deps\<name>-<hash>.exe` in parallel (32 cores, direct
exes take no cargo lock), parse their summary lines. Three hard-won
rules: (a) only the hashes from the LATEST `--no-run` list are current -
deps/ keeps stale old-hash binaries that test old code (a false FAILED
from a pre-edit binary cost a detour); (b) Start-Process ExitCode under
redirection is unreliable in .NET (WaitForExit(ms) returns before the
stream closes) - the printed result line is the verdict, never the RC;
(c) windowed/GPU suites (the ui lib snapshot tests, egui_app, shell,
gpu_render) must run SERIALLY or they spuriously panic in shared
window/GPU state - run concurrent, they "failed"; run alone, 108
passed. Cost to change: none - it is a working method, not a product
decision; AGENTS.md's testing section now carries it.

## M3.2 A - Multiple setups (code commit `33f5658`)

**A setup is a name that owns a world frame, and the frame is the flip.**
Stage A gives a document a list of setups - `SetupDef {stock, wcs,
datum_from}` components plus one `ActiveSetup` singleton - and routes
every stock/WCS/height read through the *operation's declared* setup,
not through a cursor. The decisions inside that:

- **The implicit-setup law: zero setups is the old world, verbatim.** An
  operation's `setup` field is `Option<String>`; `None` and a setup named
  by no entity both resolve - through `setup::effective` - to the legacy
  globals `STOCK_NAME`/`WCS_SLOTS`. A pre-M3.2 document round-trips
  through v21 unchanged and every old test passes untouched (the one
  legitimate churn: calls that now take a setup argument).
- **The first `CreateSetup` MATERIALIZES; it never renames.** The new
  setup points its stock/WCS fields at the entities that already exist.
  Renaming them would move geometry under the toolpath's feet and make
  every stamp of every existing op read Stale for a bookkeeping event.
  SECOND and later setups own private furniture (`"Setup2/Stock"`,
  `"Setup2/G54"`) that is spawned LAZILY on first use - so a setup that
  is only ever a label for a flipped second face costs zero entities.
  Cost to revisit: eager furniture makes "does this setup own a block
  yet?" a schema question instead of a world read; nothing else changes.
- **Membership is declared, not cursor-derived.** `CreateOperation`
  writes the then-active setup into the new op; moving an op later is
  `SetOperationSetup`, which KEEPS the stamp - "Ok when the two setups
  place their stock identically, Stale when they do not" falls out of
  the digest machinery (stamps digest RESOLVED values - per-setup
  height Zs, the setup-resolved stock's loc+shape - not entity names),
  so no membership term in the stamp is needed and activation stays
  pure inert data. The UI cursor is a display context only.
- **One order law, rest masks same-setup-only.** `posting::program_ops`
  calls `setup::operation_order` (setup rank by name, then name), and
  `rest::prior_digest`/`prior_state` skip operations of other setups -
  the program-ahead is what THIS frame machines against. Multi-setup
  ordering is therefore rank-then-name, not browser drag order.
- **Placement is the flip; the transform is M3.3.** A new op's world
  frame comes from where its setup's stock block and WCS origins sit.
  `datum_from` is inert provenance (a string); datum TRANSFER clones
  the source's stock snap (shape+loc+facets) and placed WCS Locations
  into the new setup's OWN names - undo removes only the clones.
  Rotation/flip matrices deliberately do not exist yet: the roadmap
  files "Part orientation" under M3.2's setups/datums row, and stage E
  or M3.3's post work will attach a rotation Location to the clone.
  Cost to revisit: none - the fields are already Locations.
- **The program sim CLIPS between setups (documented conservative
  law).** `stock_sim::simulate_document` walks ops in program order and
  at each setup change folds in the new block by lowering columns to at
  most the new stock's top, never moving what the previous setup cut -
  a re-clamped face reads as leftover (rest, visible) rather than as
  air (a gouge). A rotated or from-model stock in a LATER setup refuses
  the sim outright: the frame cannot be judged, so it is not guessed.
- **G-code words never followed the setup; entities did.** Posting
  still writes the `WCS_SLOTS[slot]` literals - the machine's offset
  register is the machine's, and the setup's private G54 entity is a
  *value* posted into that word. Furniture names are RESERVED
  (`AddTool` refuses `is_furniture_shape` names; setup-name validation
  refuses `Stock`/`G54..G59`/`Setup1/G54`/blank).
- **Delete refuses while any op belongs, naming it**; `ActivateSetup`
  of a deleted setup is legal but dangling (reads fall to the first
  existing setup), and undo replays furniture restores BY NAME, which
  is how the lazily-spawned entities stay consistent across the
  history walk.

v20 -> v21 step-up is pure serde-default: `setup` kind, per-entity
`stock`/`wcs`/`datum_from`, op-level `setup`, top-level `active_setup`.
A v21 save of a setup-free document is byte-equivalent in meaning to
its v20 (the step-up test pins it).

## M3.1 D - Re-machining (this commit)

**The program ahead of an operation is an input, and the honest digest
of it is the PATH ON RECORD.** Stage D made `Pocket3D` read the rest
material its predecessors left: `rest::prior_state` replays every
earlier operation's cached moves through the `stock_sim` dexel grid and
hands the generator a mask that only ever REMOVES cuts (a masked run is
always a subset of the unmasked one - skipping columns whose material
already stands low cuts air, never gouges). The decisions inside that
one sentence:

- **The predecessor's digest term is a hash of its cached moves, not
  its recorded stamp.** The first design hashed stamps; the survey of
  the command layer showed why that cannot work: `EditOperationParams`
  drops an operation's stamp to `None` (the "staleness on the copy"
  convention from M3.1 B/C), so a mere parameter edit - which changes
  NOTHING the machine would post today, because the cache still holds
  the old path - would have marked every dependent operation Stale.
  The path-hash term keeps the law the rest module documents: a
  dependent regenerates when what would post moves, and a program of
  edited-but-unregenerated predecessors converges in two
  `RegenerateAll` rounds (round 1 regenerates the edited predecessors
  - the dependent was Ok when the batch was built, so it is not in it;
  the new caches then mark the dependent Stale; round 2 re-machines
  it). Cost to revisit: the digest walk clones and hashes every
  predecessor's cached moves on every `status_of` - the same order of
  work the world-read (`toolpath_of` returns an owned clone) already
  forces, but O(path) per frame per dependent is more than stage C's
  cheap-live-questions budget intends. A memoized `path_digest` u64 on
  the cached-Toolpath component, written at generation, would make it
  O(1); it needs a `#[serde(default)]` field addition (0 means
  "compute once"), not a version bump - a good M3.x tune-up.
- **`prior_stale` is the LAST question in `stale_reason`, and reaching
  it forces the answer.** Every own-input question (tool, source,
  picks, heights) came back clean while the stamp still mismatches -
  so the rest digest is what moved, and only a cutting predecessor can
  move it: the reason names the first cutting predecessor and says
  "regenerate the program in order". In the compound case (this
  operation's parameters WERE edited, and a predecessor also cuts) the
  advice is still exactly right - regenerating the program fixes both
  - but the attribution may name the predecessor when part of the
  story is its own edit. The single-digest stamp cannot split that;
  saying so would need the per-term baselines that stage C declined.
- **The mask applies to every `Pocket3D`, not only `rest_rough`
  ones.** The flag's job is the closing rest pass; the level ladder's
  "don't recut what stands lower" law is independent of it. This makes
  a redundant duplicate operation refuse as Empty ("the operations
  ahead in the program already machined this area") instead of
  silently air-cutting - the Prime Directive at the program level.
- **A never-generated predecessor contributes only its name to the
  digest**; the first operation of a program has no rest term at all,
  so existing stamps are bit-for-bit what they were before stage D
  (the inert-data law), and nothing in persistence changed (v20
  stands).
- **Rotated stock refuses by name, not by guesswork.** The program
  sim needs an axis-aligned grid; a job whose stock carries a rotation
  gets `rest from previous operations: the program sim models an
  axis-aligned stock; this stock carries a rotation` out of generate -
  honest, and fixable by re-seating the stock.
- **Program order is the post's order - the name-sort wart included.**
  `rest::ahead_of` walks `named_entities` in the same order
  `posting::program_ops` does, so an operation named `Operation10`
  sorts ahead of `Operation2` for re-machining exactly as it does for
  the machine. Fixing the sort (creation-order or explicit sequence
  numbers) is a roadmap question; forking it here would make
  re-machining disagree with the post, which is the one disagreement
  this feature must never have.
- **The fixture law the tests encode:** a `Pocket3D` footprint is the
  model's projected silhouette minus the columns the solid still fills
  - so a through-cavity model has its void OUTSIDE the region a pocket
  will ever enter, and re-machining tests must model a SOLID plate
  with a BLIND pocket. (Found the hard way: a through-hole plate made
  every masked level read empty. The law itself is M2.1's and correct;
  the test geometry was lying.)

## M3.1 C - Geometry association workflow

**"References, not copies" was already true; stage C made it felt.** The
survey's finding: picks store feature IDS (content hashes), resolved
against the live world at every read, re-validated at pick time by
`valid_pick` - no operation holds a frozen geometry copy. Drill holes
stay params-data by the M1.6 decision (they are the pattern's geometry,
and the model-change → Stale path already catches drift). What a user
could not do was find out WHY a row reads STALE or fix a whole revision
at once. Two additions:

- **`stale_reason` asks the world live questions, not a stored
  baseline.** The stamp is one digest and cannot itself say what moved.
  The chosen design asks, in order: is the tool still there and still a
  tool; does the stock/source entity still exist; does every picked
  feature id still exist in its entity's live geometry; can every height
  still resolve. When all pass, the honest answer is the general one.
  The alternative design - storing a per-operation features baseline
  (parts inventory) in the doc - would give exact set-differences ("two
  faces moved, one added") at the price of a v21 persistence bump and a
  new digest per generation. The live-questions version is ~80% as
  precise, needs no persistence, and can never disagree with the world.
  Cost to revisit: the baseline design layers ON this one - the question
  order stays, the membership check just compares a stored set instead
  of re-deriving `features_of_local`.
- **`RegenerateAll` is skip-not-fatal, and one undo unit.** A stale
  operation whose generator refuses (its tool vanished) must not block
  the rest of the job - it keeps its old cache and its STALE tag
  honestly, and the batch lists it by name. This follows validate-early:
  construction runs every generator, so `apply`/`invert` are pure writes
  and the compound inverts in reverse. Deliberate scope: NEVER and OK
  operations are untouched - this is the revision-fix, not a build-all
  (first-time generation stays a per-op choice).
- **The affordance lives in the status strip, and only exists when
  stale > 0.** The tree marks rows individually and the properties page
  explains individually; the batch belongs to no entity, so it rides
  the bar - and retires with the staleness, so the fresh-document
  snapshot churns zero (verified: both snapshots unchanged).
- **`for_each_height` joins `stamp_with` as the second Height-soup list**
  - one fn enumerates every Height field per variant for the reason
  scan. New Height params must go in BOTH lists; the doc comment says
  so, and a missed field is a silent blind spot (the compiler cannot
  catch it - flagged for discussion, along with whether the two soups
  should later merge into one generated list).

## M3.1 B - Parameter propagation (this commit)

**The stamp should read what the path reads.** Stage B's survey found the
"stock, tool or WCS" bullet was two-thirds done by architecture: the tool
arm already digests the named tool entity's live numbers (a `ChangeTool`
edits the entity every stamp reads through), and `stamp_with` folds each
`Height`'s *resolved* Z - which asks the world for stock/model bounds and
the WCS slot's placement. `heights.rs` and `operations.rs` already lock
that behavior with tests; nothing was added, it was verified. The real gap
was one arm: `FromModel` stock, whose geometry is a materialized copy, was
digesting only the copy's NAME.

- **Propagation happens inside the update command, not lazily at read
  time.** `UpdateModel` snapshots any derived stock's facets at
  construction and writes the new ones at apply, so model and material
  trade back together on undo - one user action, one undo unit. The
  alternative (stock geometry re-derived on every read) threads a
  special-case layer through viewer, simulator, and post; the codebase's
  law is that the world holds the truth, and `SetStock` already
  materializes copies. Cost to revisit: the guard is a single
  `stock_of()` predicate; a lazy scheme would delete its two write sites
  and add a derivation to each consumer instead.
- **The stock stamp digests the copy, not the source.** The generator
  mills the stock's facets, so the stock's facets are what staleness
  tracks - the source's name stays in the digest as provenance only.
  Deliberate consequence: delete the source model and stock-based
  operations stay Ok, because the material they describe has not moved
  (a test pins it). Placement is never re-adopted either: an update
  changes the metal, not the setup - the stock's own `Location` stays as
  the user put it.
- **The Selection arm joined the ids-as-signatures law.** It digested
  `feature::digest_of` (per-facet positions), which churns a pick on a
  pure re-tessellation whose faces all survive. It now digests
  `revision::signature`, same as the Entity arm; chain and patch ids are
  derived from face content, so a surviving face set cannot hide a moved
  pick. `digest_of` stays as the Features cache key (model.rs) - there it
  is exactly right, a content address for memoization.
- **No persistence change.** Propagation is a command-time write; the
  stock's facets are already persisted in v20, so load never needs to
  re-derive anything and the version stays put.

## M3.1 A - Model revisions and stable feature identity (this commit)

**A model revision is a content event, and content already has ids.** Stage
A set out to detect "the CAD changed, which faces moved" the way the
pre-compaction plan sketched: per-revision geometric signatures plus a
greedy successor matcher (0.5 mm centers, 25 % area slack). Building it
turned the plan inside out: `feature.rs` face/patch/chain ids ARE content
hashes - exact-integer plane signatures, welded corner positions, quantized
areas - so diffing two revisions is a set difference over stable ids. No
matcher was needed, and none was written.

- **Ids-as-signatures replace the geometric matcher.** A face that survives
  a re-mesh keeps its id byte for byte; one that moved lands in
  `missing`/`added`. Pairing a missing id with an added one ("the same face,
  moved") is deliberately NOT guessed anywhere in Stage A - successor
  pairing is Stage C's decision, made visible to the user through re-pick
  affordances, never assumed by a tolerance. The cost to revisit: a matcher
  would be additive (a `candidates()` beside `IdDiff`), nothing in the diff
  law has to change first.
- **The stamp's Entity arm digests the signature, not count + AABB.** The
  old arm let a diamond prism swap in under a contour operation and keep
  the stamp - twelve facets, same box, silent gouge fuel. `revision::
  signature` is the multiset of face ids plus counts: order-free,
  winding-free, diagonal-flip-free (each invariance is a test), and it
  moves exactly when the material moves. Consequence, said plainly:
  existing saved documents re-open with their Entity-sourced operations
  Stale once - the stored stamps were computed under the old digest. Same
  one-time churn as the `b3eaebc` stamp move; the mechanism working, not
  broken.
- **Re-import by name is an update, not a conflict.** The worker thread
  stays world-blind (it cannot know the name exists); `finish_import` on
  the main thread routes: no entity - `ImportModel` (spawn, rev 1); an
  entity - `UpdateModel::new`, which refuses to overwrite setup furniture
  and refuses empty geometry at construction. Undo trades geometry back
  exactly - it never deletes a model the user only updated. `ImportModel`
  itself keeps its early-return-if-exists as the redo/idempotence guard
  only.
- **`Revision` is bookkeeping, never a staleness input.** The u64 counter
  says "geometry landed here N times" for the tree and the save file; the
  stamp rehashes the facets themselves, so a save-load round-trip can
  never inherit staleness from a counter that drifted. v20 persistence is
  the pure step-up: absent key means 0 means "pre-M3.1, nothing
  remembered"; a model first updated after loading such a file lands rev 1.
- **FromModel stock propagation is Stage B, not here.** The stock's stamp
  arm still digests the source model's NAME, so re-importing under that
  name leaves a FromModel stock silently Ok. It is the same silent-gap
  class the Entity arm just closed, and it gets the same treatment in
  Stage B (stamp inputs) - noted here so the gap is owned, not forgotten.

## M2.2e - Ramp entries, stage D: the certified diagonal chain (this commit)

**Ramp is a law about the space BETWEEN cuts.** Stage D adds one bool to
Finish3DParams and one branch to the runs emitter: with `ramp` on, the
link from one raster line's end to the next - the serpentine's lateral
step, or a longer diagonal at a group boundary - is certified against
the terrain, and where it certifies the hop's up-rapid-plunge triple
collapses into a single Feed. The discovery that shaped the tests: the
Parallel raster walks serpentine, so its connectors are one-stepover
laterals, not across-shelf diagonals. On flat ground the chain is the
classic no-lift raster: `45 plunges / 52 rapides` becomes `12 / 18`
while the ring phase's 43 arcs ride on untouched - the golden diff
reads exactly like the law.

- **The bool, not the enum.** Pocket's Entry3D has Ramp and Helix; the
  3D finish's between-lines motion has no honest Helix geometry (a helix
  needs XY room the stepover doesn't offer), and an arm that can only be
  refused is an arm that must be refused at the gate - validate-early
  says don't ship a parameter the generator cannot keep. `ramp: bool`
  states exactly the promise kept.
- **Certification is the support's answer, not the design's guess.**
  `diagonal_ok` samples the straight cut and asks `support_at` at each
  probe (n = d_xy / (tol/4)): center z + r must meet the support within
  tol. A convex dome sinks its chords and thereby refuses them - the
  hill test asserts the COUNT never grows and the kernel never
  complains, but NOT that any particular hop survives; that is the
  support's business. The envelope verifier remains the real gouge
  law; this certification is the generator keeping its own promise
  before the verifier ever runs.
- **A claim too wide to check is declined.** The 4096-probe cap makes
  honesty cheap: NaN spans and over-cap spans both land in `false`, and
  the declined path is BYTE-IDENTICAL to the hop (test 3: explicit
  0.5 mm spacing under tol 1e-4 puts the lateral connector at 20000
  probes - every link refuses, the two paths match move for move).
  Same budget-stated-zero law as the solid-rest work.
- **Rings and first contacts never route through the chain.** The
  branch lives in the runs emitter's `i > 0` arm alone; the all-steep
  wall test pins the law as byte-inertness of the flag where rings are
  the whole path.
- **Wire:** PROJECT_VERSION 17, pure serde-default step-up - absent
  `ramp` is `false` is the hop, what v16 ran; written always, like
  `climb`. **Stamp:** one byte appended to the Finish3D arm - every
  existing Finish3D op goes Stale exactly once, "step-up is the stamp
  itself", like every bump since v6.


## M2.2e - Around the model, stage C: the center-shadow families and the two-door spacing law

- **The shadow, not a level: one XY domain for a height-free
  family.** Contour and Project march Z-following loops over ground
  that has no single center-height - so their placement region is
  NOT `level_region`'s z-slice but the terrain's CENTER-SHADOW: every
  shallow facet's XY triangle TRANSLATED by `r·m_xy` (a plane's
  tangent centers form that plane shifted by its lean; the shadow of
  that sheet is the shifted triangle), unioned. Steep facets
  contribute nothing - the same jurisdiction every other family
  keeps - and holes of the shadow (islands, air under an overhang)
  answer through `support_at`'s own ball-clear law: a center that
  cannot rest simply breaks the piece, never a lie. Cost to change:
  the shadow is one function; making it z-aware later would just
  mean re-slicing it per level, but then it stops being one truth
  about the plan view and starts being N truths, one per rung.
- **A closed loop closed BY the march.** `march_loop` turns a Region
  loop into an arc-length parameterization (cumulative chords,
  summed in walk order) and feeds the shared kernel - so the
  validity bisection, quarter-budget chords and discontinuity break
  are not re-implemented, they are REUSED, and the ring-close falls
  out of the sampling laws: the clamp sample at `t = L` lands exactly
  on the entry point, and `push_run_pt`'s duplicate law (which
  compares against the PREVIOUS point, not the first) keeps it as
  the closing move. A test now pins it on the plateau. The other
  half of the law: a loop that broke at a shelf mouth does NOT close
  - its piece ends where the ground ended.
- **Outermost-first, entry-point-second - loop order as a fact about
  the model.** Clipper's memory is not a deterministic source, and a
  stamp that churns is a stamp that lies, so `shadow_pass` sorts by
  |area| descending, then by first point (x, then y). Both orders
  total under f64::total_cmp. Same law the rings' area-sort serves.
- **The two-door spacing law (a test-failure that reversed a claim).**
  Stage C's design note said "Project ignores the stepover" after the
  Waterline precedent. The first test run proved that claim WRONG in
  the interesting direction: `validate`'s early gate refuses a
  zero/NaN stepover from EVERY pattern - even one that never reads
  it - because AGENTS.md's "validate early" outranks "ignore
  gracefully", and Waterline already pays that gate today. So the
  honest split is TWO doors: the GATE (is the number a number) speaks
  to all patterns; the COST guard (8192-ring cap, the arithmetic
  message) speaks only where spacing marches - contour at a hairline
  stepover is hours of rings and must refuse; project's single rim
  costs no spacing budget and sails past the guard. The shipped test
  pins both doors separately.
- **The immortal-sliver belt.** The cap guard rejects a family that
  would NEED more than 8192 offsets; the while-loop additionally
  breaks at 8194 rings whatever the guard said, so numerically
  immortal geometry (a sliver that refuses to collapse) yields a
  long honest path, never a hang. A CAM kernel must terminate on its
  own arithmetic, not on its optimizer's.

## M2.2d - Polar placements, stage B: radial chords, the spiral, and the march that must end

- **The polar families are raster families by construction.** Radial
  lays `N = ceil(π·R/s)` chords through the shallow footprint's center
  - arc spacing at the rim meets the cos-law stepover, and toward the
  center they overlap ever more (the cusp law is a bound, never a
  quota); the spiral is ONE Archimedean curve in from the silhouette,
  ending a half-stepover from the pole because the next turn would
  only retrace. Both share the parallel raster's actual machinery:
  one adaptive march (`march_curve`: validity bisection, the quarter-
  budget chord refinement, the discontinuity break), one hop
  choreography (`emit_runs`), one ring close (`rings_and_tail`).
  Three ground layouts, one set of laws - and the extraction is
  byte-identical for the old paths (the float algebra that keeps it
  so: `4.0 * delta0 == delta0 * 4.0` exactly, `* 1.0` exact), every
  golden unchanged. Over a cap of 8192 ground lines the placement
  refuses with its arithmetic in the message - it is a bound on
  march-hours, not a taste. Cost to change: a fourth layout should
  join this trio, not fork another march.

- **A parameter march ends by a labeled break, not by fixture luck.**
  The spiral always reaches the END of its parameter range standing
  on valid ground (its inner limit is cuttable hill, by the apex
  law); the two-level loop - `while t <= t1` around an inner `loop` -
  took the "no progress" break at the inner level, returned to the
  outer condition, found it still TRUE at t == t1, re-clamped the
  same sample: a silent infinite spin. Twenty release minutes of it
  before the suspicion was right. The extracted raster code had the
  SAME structure, hidden only because a raster march always dies at
  the bbox edge, in the skip phase whose bare `break` does exit the
  while. Now both no-progress arms - clamp-landed and float
  stagnation (`t + delta·unit(t) == t` with t < t1: the parameter has
  grown too far for the step to move it) - `break 'march` outright.
  Cost to change: every future parameterized curve (any M2.2e
  family) must keep BOTH breaks; re-deriving the exit per family is
  how this bug survived a whole milestone of green gates.

- **Ring strokes and march samples obey different laws, and Z tells
  them apart.** Building the structural test surfaced it: the rings
  legitimately emit long lateral Feeds - iso-z tangent loci, and the
  exact-straight collapse keeps a wall's length chord-free - while
  the march owes the stepdown budget per move. So the test bounds
  XY-span on the FEEDS THAT CHANGE Z (rings ride one tip plane; on a
  curved model every march sample climbs). Related, logged as known
  behavior rather than a phantom: a lone sheet gets edge-grazing
  rings at EVERY ladder level - the forbidden-center law is being
  faithful (tangent = zero material removed), not leaking; on a
  closed solid those same levels hug the walls.

- **Append-only ordinals slot polar words into the v16 grammar with
  no bump.** `Radial = 4`, `Spiral = 5` extend FinishPattern, digest
  into the stamp through the existing `*pattern as u8` (since
  M2.2b), and write as new words in the same `pattern` field; older
  files never see them, unknown words still refuse Corrupt, so no
  cross-version confusion is reachable. Cost to change: reordering
  the enum invalidates every digest - all finishing ops' stamps go
  stale at once; the append-only law is a cache law, not aesthetics.

## M2.2d - Hidden rest: solid truth behind the height field, stage A

- **Parity membership is decided by CLAIMS, not by half-open edge
  ownership.** The textbook ray-parity test needs each column to count
  every coincident sheet once per sheet. The clever O(1) alternative -
  per-triangle half-open (u,v >= 0, u+v < 1) ownership of shared
  edges - FAILS twice over: a closed box's center sits ON both caps'
  shared diagonal, and cancelling the pair (the natural "two claims,
  one crossing" reflex) erases a real crossing; two flush sheets
  stacked face-on-face collapse to one crossing and lie about
  material. The shipped law (solid_rest law (a)): every containing
  facet claims INTERIOR (strict barycentric beyond 1e-12) or
  BOUNDARY; at each coincident-z cluster, per plane group (normals
  equal up to sign - winding-blind, law (c)), crossings = interior
  count, else 1 for bare boundary claims (adjacent pieces of ONE
  sheet merge honestly). The knife edge - a column riding two flush
  sheets' own shared edge - cannot be told apart, and the merge
  chooses to merge: the result is ODD and reported `Crossings::Open`,
  an unknown, never asserted material. Doubt biases toward unknown
  because unknown costs a report, a lie costs a crash. Cost to
  change: any edge-ownership shortcut re-opens the diagonal hole;
  the claim lists are what a future BVH pruning feeds on, so the
  interface survives, the settles do not.
- **The union is in the FIELD only - hidden rest never touches a
  predicate.** `EnvelopeReport.rest_mm`/`at` gain the solid truth
  (material tops occluded by a ceiling, judged by the SAME distance
  law: nearest center - r - floor); the ridge pass, rest_cells,
  gouge and the tolerance math are computed exactly as before. Every
  existing golden is byte-identical (proved: release full-suite
  regression alongside this commit) because on prismatic fixtures
  the highest paired interval top IS the height-field top, so the
  occlusion filter (`hi >= t - floor: continue`) rejects everything.
  Cost to change: folding hidden rest into rest_cells would make the
  standing-mask region depend on ray parity - the region and the
  scalar would stop agreeing, and `measure`'s removal accounting
  rides the region.
- **Over budget the hidden scan answers with the STATED ZERO.** The
  per-column claim bins cost 24 B/cell plus claims; budgets are
  1.2 M cells (~30 MB of headers) and 40 M claims. Beyond them
  hidden_rest returns 0.0, i.e. "the height field's debt stays on
  the books" - the report degrades to exactly M2.2c behavior, and
  the degrade is structural (a missing number), not a guessed one.
  Discussion point: a `rest_hidden: bool`-style flag on
  EnvelopeReport saying "the solid scan skipped" - cheap to add,
  would make the zero visible instead of inferable; left off this
  stage because nothing reads it yet.
- **The hidden scan has NO XY window on the distance loop; the ridge
  law's soundness argument does not transfer.** Pruning segs to the
  column's r + band square is valid for the ridge pass ONLY because
  its near >= 2 predicate masks the case where a far-but-relevant
  seg exists; with every segment excluded the ridge law's `continue`
  fires first. A hidden column has no such mask: dmin = infinity
  would silently report "reachable" for deep material. The full
  O(columns x segs) distance loop is therefore deliberate; it is the
  honest half of the cost of the union. Cost to change: a proper
  XY BVH over segs with an exact lower-bound - the window's
  failure mode, not its shape.

## M2.2c - Scallop as the diagonal cross

- **Gate speed, measured and then halved: the kernel tests are
  profile-invariant, so the overnight ladder can run them in release.**
  The scallop dome envelope costs 1073 s single-threaded in debug (the
  O(moves × facets) sweep is the point of law (f) - brute force, not a
  formula). Rust's f64 is IEEE and nothing here fast-math-reassociates,
  so the release profile computes the same bits: `golden_cl` passes
  15/15 under `--release` against the debug-regenerated goldens,
  0.29 s wall. Discussion point: whether future milestone gates run
  the envelope-kernel binaries in release by default and reserve debug
  for the refusal/round-trip suites.

- **Scallop ships as the ±45-deg crossed raster - NOT as a
  curvature-adaptive family.** The roadmap's bullet is "constant cusp
  height", and the industry name carries two readings: (a) the
  crossed 90-deg pair CAM tools ship, and (b) the research-grade
  scallop whose step direction follows the surface's principal
  curvature at every point. We implemented (a), rotated 45-deg from
  ParallelMulti's axes so the third option genuinely adds coverage:
  on this codebase's prismatic models every linear feature runs along
  X or Y, and the diagonals are the only directions no single-family
  raster crosses head-on. Discussion point: (b) is the honest M2.6
  candidate (flow-field families, per-point sec-law); if the user
  expects scallop to run FEWER passes than parallel at the same
  cusp, that expectation is not met here, deliberately - see next.
- **No sqrt(2) stepover discount, and why - the union-of-removal
  argument.** The folklore claim "crossing halves the cusp, so step
  over sqrt(2) wider" is FALSE for a plane: every point of the grid
  lies within s/2 of a line in EACH family, and the removed height at
  a point is the MAX over passes (material falls if any ball uncovers
  it), so the crossed pattern's worst point - the cell center, s/2
  from both - is exactly the single family's worst point: s^2/8r.
  The crossing earns its keep on CURVED and prismatic terrain, where
  a feature parallel to one family is cut diagonally by the other;
  the tests measure that verdict instead of assuming either factor.
  Cost to change: one line in `scallop_stepover`'s use if a future
  measurement ever shows the discount is real for a specific
  pattern - we do not ship unearned stepovers.
- **Persistence: a new WORD is not a new GRAMMAR - v16 stands.** The
  v16 bump at M2.2b was for two new FIELDS (needed serde defaults on
  old files); `scallop` is a new spelling in the existing pattern
  field: no v16 file carries it, every v16 file still reads
  byte-identically, and an unknown word refuses as Corrupt at load
  (tested) rather than defaulting. The stamp follows automatically:
  `pattern as u8` = 3 for Scallop, so switching is Stale-green like
  every other param move.
- **The scallop golden rides the plateau, not the cone - the razor
  rule for goldens.** The cone's flank facets sit at m_z = cos(45)
  EXACTLY on the SPLIT_MZ jurisdiction line; a float wobble across
  that equality flips a facet from shallow to steep and churns the
  golden for non-law reasons. The plateau's shelf (m_z = 1) and walls
  (m_z = 0) are nowhere near the line, so `finish3d_scallop_plateau.cl`
  pins the diagonal crossing, the break law and the ring handover
  with zero razor. (Waterline's cone golden predates the raster and
  never reads `shallow`, so it stays.)
- **The scallop test flipped a bug hunt: `verify`'s Crossing law is
  blind in Envelope mode.** The first scallop battery went red with
  ~100 `Crossing` warnings on dome, plateau and tilt - while the
  envelope kernel called all three paths clean. The two verdicts
  disagree because the law predates crossed rasters: "two feeds
  cross in XY at shared depth" was written when that phrase could
  only mean a chord dragged across a pocket, and a scallop makes it
  mean "the two families did their job." Standing it down in
  `Mode::Envelope` (law comment at the gate, module doc updated) is
  the honest shape - the chord that could actually hurt there is a
  chord biting into or sailing above the surface, and law (f)
  measures exactly that, move by move. The 2D modes keep the law
  byte-identical (the verify.rs tests at `Mode::Area` still assert
  it fires). Side effect worth knowing: the law was quadratic in the
  move count, and the finish3d battery spent 1866 s - most of it in
  Envelope-mode verifies that were about to report only by-design
  crossings. Expect the suite to run dramatically faster.
- **A fixture bug, not a pattern bug: the tilted scallop's "gouge."**
  The one failure after the verify fix put 1.09 mm of gouge at a
  corner of a `tilted(30deg, half = 60)` slab - a mesh whose tilted
  top falls below its own base and 30 mm above the op's declared
  band. Tangent balls cannot gouge a plane, so the kernel was
  correctly measuring a self-intersecting model. Switched to the
  `half = 8` fixture the cos-law test actually uses (comment states
  the law). Discussion point: nothing today refuses a non-solid
  model at import or generation - a validation pass for the
  M3-era audit list, if the user wants degenerate-mesh refusals
  priced in.
- **Scallop reuses `parallel()` end to end** - same raster_pass,
  cos-law, flush/break laws, ring auto-split, refusals, stepover
  override. The variant buys its two directions in the match arm;
  every raster refusal test is a `scallop_shares_the_raster_refusals`
  call, not a copy of the parallel set.

## M2.2b - Parallel raster, the 45-deg auto-split, and two bug hunts (commit `ac7413c`)

- **The underside "gouge" was our fixture, not the generator - and the
  reversal matters.** Mid-milestone we believed `facet_polygon`'s
  symmetric forbidden-center set (a facet ⊕ a ball of zero thickness
  = valid centers on BOTH sides of the sheet) was an underside bug and
  had a candidate-offset fix (`q + r·n̂`) designed. It was never
  written: the tilted test mesh was a single open sheet, and an open
  sheet has a phantom back side a ring lawfully rests on that no
  height-field measure can tell from material. Closing the fixture
  into a wedge made the "gouge" vanish with zero generator change -
  the symmetric law is correct for closed solids, which is everything
  we machine. Discussion point: whether the verifier should REJECT
  open shells at import with a "not a solid" diagnostic, rather than
  letting a phantom-back-side path through at all; today we generate
  on them and the envelope measure honestly reports the rest they
  leave. Cost to change: an orientation/enclosure check in
  `decompose`, but it would refuse files current tests feed on
  purpose.
- **The ring arc-fit budget: `tolerance * 0.25`, not full tolerance.**
  The region boundary is already tessellated, so its vertices sit a
  chord-sag INSIDE the true offset locus; letting `fit_arcs` shortcut
  its own samples at full tolerance stacks a second sag on the first,
  and it shows at corners where the vertex-sphere radius
  ρ = √(r² − (cz−q_z)²) changes fastest (measured: a fitted R=6.3
  circle cut 2.43 from a corner whose true locus is 2.52 - a 0.144 mm
  gouge at 0.01 tolerance). The raster already fit its boundary chains
  at tol/4; the ring now matches. Law: any fitter whose input is
  already tessellated gets the quarter budget. The envelope verifier
  caught this with its own numbers, no assertion was weakened.
- **The None-gap flush law.** After a line segment resolves to air
  (occluded or unsupported), the next supported run must START a new
  piece, not extend the previous arc chain - straddling the gap let
  the blind-pocket floor gouge until the fix landed. Same family as
  the discontinuity-break law: a raster line is a promise of
  continuous contact; where the contact breaks, the path breaks.
- **Multi-direction is two raster passes with retract hops, not a
  rotated toolpath.** 0° then 90° over the same levels, each pass
  individually continuous. It doubles the plunge count; the posting
  question (hops vs full retract at M1.7) rides the same answer as
  the XY pass's hops.
- **`retype` now defaults Finish3D to Parallel, not Waterline.** A new
  3D finish op on a flat-topped plateau with Waterline alone would
  leave every flat shelf standing proud of tolerance - a silent miss,
  the one answer this app never gives. Parallel covers flats AND
  steep flanks (via the auto-split); Waterline remains one combo
  click away. Cost to change: one line, but every "fresh op" golden
  and UI test follows it.
- **Stepover override: stored ≠ derived, and Some() is legal under
  every pattern.** The params carry `Option<f64>`: None means the
  cos-law derivation, Some means the machinist's call wins even where
  it is coarser than tolerance demands (that is often the point -
  cusp aesthetics, cycle time). `is_sane` checks positivity only; the
  pattern that ignores it (Waterline) says so in its own generate, not
  in a refusal.
- **Height-field occlusion means hidden rest is invisible - deferred
  to M2.2d with eyes open.** Under a ceiling, the envelope's
  per-column "part" is the topmost surface, so material sheltered
  below it never appears in the rest measure, and the floor-outranks
  law keeps the raster on the ceiling where that is the support. The
  hidden-floor test now asserts exactly what can be KNOWN (path never
  below bottom, verifier silent, ceiling ridden) and its comment
  names M2.2d's rest-reporting job: a true hidden-rest answer needs
  the solid-truth (inside/outside) scan, not the height-field one.
- **The headless gate was racing: `drain_actions()` is one poll, and
  imports went async at `e867bea`.** smoke.rs now calls
  `State::settle()` (blocking drain, 120 s deadline). Every milestone
  since the async import ran this gate on a race it happened to win -
  found here because the tilted fixture changed the import's timing,
  not its geometry. Discussion point: whether `settle()`'s deadline
  should be shorter so a hung import fails the gate fast instead of
  after 120 s.
- **The golden churned honestly:** `finish3d_waterline_cone.cl` went
  118 → 121 moves from the ring's quarter-budget fit (two rings
  gained a corner arc - the fix working), reviewed segment by segment
  before `WRITE_GOLDEN=1`.

## M2.2a - Waterline contouring and the envelope kernel (commit `c755b12`)

- **The outer-loop-only law: cut what the region encloses from outside.**
  The forbidden-center region's CW loops are interior wavefronts - the
  ball cannot reach a hole's forbidden disk by rolling on the model's
  outside, so those loops are unreachable geometry, not missed rings.
  Islands are separate CCW components and get walked. Discussion point:
  a model whose interior cavity opens only through a smaller neck would
  need a reachability test to be contourable from the inside; we do not
  attempt inside-out waterlines at all yet (and no test asserts we
  would notice). Cost to change: a component-reachability pass before
  the outer filter, ~30 lines, but it re-opens the nesting question
  with the sketch-parity law that union_all(NONZERO) closed.
- **Two truths, each by its own law.** Gouge is dexel truth (what the
  ball's lowest points removed, column by column); rest is distance
  truth at RIDGES - surface points with at least two band contacts.
  Why two laws, not one grid: "this pass rolled a ladder over you" is
  the pass's promise, and the promise is exactly two near-chords - a
  once-grazed point (a lone annulus) or untouched point (a flat shelf,
  the crown, a vertical wall) is rest machining's or a later op's
  jurisdiction, law there, not a silent zero here. The tempting gate
  "rest only where this pass cut the column" was PROVED dead: a ball
  reaching a column's surface is the same event as a center standing
  inside `r + floor` (it rearranges algebraically), so such a gate can
  never report the scallop it exists to measure. Cost to change: the
  ridge count is one comparison in `envelope_scan`; a different
  promise-band law touches nothing else.
- **The exact-arc collapse - and what it broke in our own tests.** The
  region fixes (union_all + outer filter) replaced clipper-boolean
  polygons with exact analytic circles, so `fit_arcs` legitimately
  collapses each ring to two or four exact arcs (180-degree
  semicircles on a true circle have zero sagitta - the arc IS the
  ring). Paths became ~5x shorter (the cone golden: 118 moves, 32
  arcs; the suite: 54-180 s where it ran 930 s). Two consequences
  logged: (1) an endpoint shoelace over such a ring is a sliver
  between antipodal vertices, not its footprint - the mirror-walk
  test now samples arcs <= 15 degrees before taking the area (and the
  box test now asserts the measured truth, `gouge == 0, rest <=
  gate`, where the corner columns honestly read a sub-gate cusp from
  the two wall rings grazing at right angles - silence was always the
  VERIFIER's word, not the scan's); (2) semicircular 180-degree arcs
  post fine under RS-274 single-block IJ format, but the M3.x posts
  should note multi-block arc splits are not needed for waterlines.
- **Hop law, finish flavor:** the inter-ring rapid rides
  `min(retract_z, clearance)` - a level change still climbs to
  clearance; `retract_z` non-finite refuses at the params check. Same
  shape the 2D ops established, tested on twin domes (one dome has
  nothing to hop between - the fixture says so).
- **The probe-before-assumption lesson, filed:** the "13/13 green"
  log we trusted predated the region fixes; the first real full-suite
  run after them failed two tests that had never actually been re-run.
  The geometry had gotten BETTER (exact circles) and two test metrics
  had quietly become invalid. A stale green is the same failure class
  as a silent gouge - re-run the binaries after any law change, even
  when the theory says "this cannot change the answers".
- **Walls are column-invisible; shelves are parallel's.** The dexel
  model sees one z per XY, so a box's vertical faces carry no surface
  sample: waterline rings graze their rims tangentially and the box
  finish is structurally left to the parallel strategy (M2.2b) - the
  test documents the jurisdiction rather than pretending the envelope
  watched the walls. The module's entry law stands: overhangs (under-
  cuts the ring can't see coming) refuse LOUD, verified by the same
  scan.

## M2.1d - Engagement-based feed modulation (commit `b164c69`)

- **The median-anchor law: the path's own median loaded engagement sets
  what runs at the programmed feed.** f = F0 · clamp(ae_median/ae_move,
  FFO_FLOOR, 1). Why: the textbook alternative — derive ae from the
  nominal stepover (ae = step/2r, or the M2.1c sagitta relation) —
  under-reads whole strategy families: an adaptive ring engages the full
  core on its inside, a zigzag's links engage the fresh shelf ahead, and
  neither is a "stepover number". Measuring against the dexel field that
  already exists costs one dry sim run and is strategy-blind by
  construction (the dexel-as-verification-layer law again: measure, never
  derive, from the sim). Cost to change: the anchor lives in one block of
  `optimize_feed`; a nominal-formula variant would replace ~10 lines.
- **Never faster, floor 0.25: the op's feed word IS the modeled tool
  limit.** Modulation only slows toward it; light bites never bank speed.
  Why: speeding up needs a spindle/torque/power curve this build does not
  carry, and a silent speed-up is exactly the class of surprise the Prime
  Directive forbids. FFO_FLOOR = 0.25 is the handbook's roughing
  slow-down band's safe end and keeps a near-tangent read (ae→0) from
  dividing out toward a stopped tool. Discussion point: with a real
  machine file (M3.3's) a >1 band could open later, ceilinged by it.
- **The two-station chord, found by a median collapse.** v1 sampled one
  perpendicular chord at each move's midpoint; on the flat slab the
  modulation was inert — every F word stayed at the programmed feed.
  The histogram led to the two pathologies: stepover links read ae=0 (the
  chord across their travel sits fully in the trough just cut — their
  fresh material is *ahead*, along travel), and the level-1 skin moves
  read ae=0 honestly (cut plane == stock top: `top > z` is false
  everywhere). Fix: average the perpendicular chord at mid-move and at
  3/4 along the move — the trapezoid of the swept side width; a link
  now reads ~0.5, which is what it cuts, and rows are unmoved. Same
  lineage as M2.1b's phantom-cutter lesson: the measurement window must
  match what the move sweeps, and a law test now pins that the first cut
  of a level is its slowest kind.
- **Loaded-only median; air keeps the programmed feed.** Zero-engagement
  readings hold no vote in the anchor and modulate by ratio 1 (no load,
  no reason to slow — and never below the floor's division by ~0). If
  *nothing* in a path is loaded, the pass returns the path byte-identical
  — the rapid-only identity law test.
- **Planar moves only.** Plunges, ramps and helix feeds keep their
  assigned plunge_feed/feed: axial engagement is a different curve
  (chip thinning vs depth, not width) and modulating it needs a model we
  did not write. Honest scope note, not an oversight — the doc comment
  says so at the function.
- **Placement: `feed_opt: bool` on the params (the rest_rough pattern),
  stamped, v14 step-up a serde-default no-op.** It changes every F word
  it touches, so flipping it changes the stamp — old paths go Stale
  exactly when the answer changes. Absent in a v13 file means off: those
  files post byte-identical to before.
- **The post needs no change** — M1.7a's per-move F-word representation
  pays off: modulated feeds flow through `.cnc` and the Fanuc post with
  zero new machinery. One sim run per generate when the toggle is on is
  the only cost (the rest pass already runs one; discussion point if
  users find generation slow on big pockets).

## M2.1c - Constant-engagement adaptive clearing (commit `70c356b`)

- **The engagement sagitta law is the strategy: step = r·(1 − cos θ).**
  Chord geometry, published HEM literature (the 7–15 % radial-engagement
  band roughers are specced in). Why: it makes the ring family a function
  of tool radius and a single angle the user can reason about — the
  scallop on flats then follows from the same geometry — instead of a
  stepover number that silently changes load with wall curvature. Cost to
  change: the law lives in ONE function,
  `machining3d::engagement_step(tool_r, deg)`, read only through
  `Pocket3DParams::tiling_step()`; the sim cell (`min(r, step/2)`) and the
  offset machinery already key off `tiling_step()`, so any restatement of
  the law is one line.
- **Adaptive ≡ Waterline at the law step — the *tiling law*.** Both the
  3D `PocketStrategy::Adaptive` and the 2D pocket's `Adaptive` alias feed
  the same ring engine (`plan_passes`/waterline) that Waterline uses, only
  with the step computed by the engagement law instead of typed in;
  "Adaptive rings are Waterline's geometry; who chose the step is the
  caller's business" is the comment that keeps them from diverging. Why:
  one engine, one set of correctness laws; a second ring generator would
  double every join bug we could ship. Cost to change: low (a strategy
  enum arm), but then the join laws below must be proved twice.
- **Ring closure is a property of the point DATA, never a motion the
  walker adds (`close_rings` removed).** `waterline_passes` emits every
  loop with its start point repeated; `walk_pass` walks and adds nothing.
  Why: the old flag's per-level closing diagonal dragged one giant
  last→first feed across chained multi-ring passes — the crossing a verify
  test caught — and its predecessor had been *keeping the old balance law
  green* with a phantom edge; a tour that needs a synthetic move to close
  was never closed, it was papered over. Cost to change: none — moving
  closure back into the walker re-imports the phantom.
- **Containment is not non-crossing (`chord_clears` +
  `chord_crosses_path`).** A join chord proven inside the cutter-center
  area can still cut across another planned ring of the same level, so
  phase 2 now plans every ring of the level first and chains only along
  chords that properly cross none of them; the test is verify's Crossing
  criterion restricted to one chord, so an accepted chord is verify-clean
  *by construction*. Why: the Prime Directive — silent crossings are the
  worst failure, and a plan that verify would refuse must not be made.
  Cost to change: none; it is a correctness gate, not a preference.
- **Chords from different chains can cross without touching any loop —
  the cut sweep.** A shattered ring family (the boss fixture's k=3 level:
  the hole offset pokes past the box offset, four 31-pt corner slivers
  remain) links its sliver entries with chords running along the broken
  wall, and those cut across a spiral's closing chords; acceptance-time
  tests are blind to chords of not-yet-built chains. Fix: build chains,
  test every cross-chain chord pair, cut the later-listed one into an
  honest rapid hop, iterate — cutting only shrinks chord sets, so the
  sweep converges. Why: a hop is a machine movement that is TRUE; a
  crossing feed is a crash. Cost to change: none — it's the same
  non-crossing law, applied where the first version couldn't see.
- **The per-level tour-closure law, restated where close_rings died:**
  on each cutting plane every XY is feed-entered exactly as often as it is
  feed-left, except the level's two honest open ends (the plunge landing
  point, the level handoff point). Why: the old global-balance test only
  passed because of the phantom closing edge; this version says what the
  tours actually do (an open zigzag still fails it, which is the point).
  Cost to change: none — it is the test, not the policy.
- **`max_engagement` legality: (0°, 90°], default 45°, only read when
  `strategy` is Adaptive** (`is_sane` guards; 90° = half-radius step,
  beyond that the sagitta law's chord model is meaningless for a
  round tool). The 2D pocket's Adaptive needs no new field — its alias
  shares the stepover gate. Persistence v13 is a pure `#[serde(default =
  "default_engagement_deg")]` no-op step-up: old files open on
  Waterline-shaped Adaptive defaults; stamp strategy index
  `Adaptive = 3`. Cost to change: a wider range rewrites the is_sane arm
  and the page tooltip, nothing else.
- **Corner-contact geometry and engagement-based feed modulation stay in
  Feed-rate optimization, not here.** This milestone makes lateral load
  constant by SHAPE; trochoidal slots, corner-aware step handling and
  feed-rate along the path are load handled by MOTION/SPEED. Why: they
  are separately testable laws and the ROADMAP already lists them as a
  bullet. Cost to change: the enum arm for trochoidal exists in spirit
  only — no stub was added to tempt a half-law.
- **Freedom-to-operate review WAIVED by the user, 2026-10-19** ("Ignore
  any patent claims for now. Clean room or not, this is an opensource
  project with no monetary gain."), against ROADMAP's standing pre-M2.1
  note. The clean-room protocol is unchanged: HEM here is derived from
  published technical literature (sagitta/chord geometry, the
  engagement-band rule), no vendor implementation inspected. Cost to
  change: revisit before any distribution beyond open-source; the
  derivation comments in each module are the evidence trail.

## M2.1b - Dexel material simulation and rest roughing (commit `4e077ae`)

- **The dexel grid is the VERIFICATION layer, never a second source of
  truth.** One number per column - the Z of the top of standing material -
  and every verdict (rest, gouge, removed) is measured against the part
  surface read off the MESH's own facet planes, never a re-entered
  approximation. Why: the ROADMAP's standing rule for any discretized stock;
  a grid that generates while a mesh verifies is two worlds that drift.
  Cost to change: none structurally - M2.3's color map shades this same
  field; only resolution policy could move.
- **The segment-window cut law, learned the honest way: a test caught a
  phantom cutter.** `cut_chord`'s reach parameter window must be
  intersected with `[0, 1]`, and an empty window must cut NOTHING - the
  first version clamped the window's ends instead, which turned "the disc
  never reached this column on this move" into "the disc cut at the
  segment's endpoint anyway": a silent wrong answer exactly in the Prime
  Directive's forbidden class, and it had been *hiding* the corner-rest
  residue the fixed sim then honestly reports (15 false gouge cells became
  0). Why noted here: it is the strongest evidence yet that the sim exists
  to be tested against, not trusted. Cost to change: none - the clamp is
  the bug, the intersection is the law, pinned by
  `an_oblique_chord_cuts_the_reach_interval_not_the_endpoints`.
- **Chords under-sweep, so the sim over-reports rest and never invents a
  gouge.** Arcs ride `arc_chords` at `CHORD_TOL = 0.01` mm (the same
  sagitta law as everywhere else), Z interpolated at each chord endpoint;
  rapids touch nothing (G0 practice). Why: the one asymmetry worth having -
  a rest pass that chases ghosts is waste, a sim that flatters a gouge is
  danger. Cost to change: tightening the tol is a parameter; reversing the
  direction is not ever.
- **Corner rest is reported, never hidden.** A round disc has no legal
  center that reaches a square pocket's corner columns (distance > r to
  every point of the eroded center region), and the honest fixtures say
  so: 4 cells on the staircase grid, 8 on the flat slab (3+2+2+1 - grid
  phase puts the lattice 0.75 mm nearer one pair of walls), four boss
  wedges + four pocket wedges on the slab-with-boss, ≈2.9 % of removed
  volume. The pre-fix sim "passed" those tests by phantom-cutting them.
  Why: this is standard CAM reality (corner radius of a round tool), and
  the fillet / point-plunge strategies (M2.1c+ rest work) are what close
  it - not a rounding in the report. Cost to change: a fillet pass would
  make the numbers smaller, never the law different.
- **Rest entries are always plain plunges, by the nesting law.** Deeper
  plane ⇒ larger island ⇒ smaller target, so any standing column is
  superset-clear above and a vertical dive is provably legal; Ramp/Helix
  arms are guarded OFF when a rest ladder is running (`li > 0 &&
  rest.is_none()`). Why: a diagonal entry through standing stair material
  would be a lie the level law never sanctioned. Cost to change: low, once
  per-level side-clear proofs exist.
- **The rest ladder's all-clear is SUCCESS, not an error.** A fully-cut
  pocket has empty targets at every level; `GenError::Empty` from the rest
  run is caught, the path byte-identical to the plain ladder (prefix
  identity is asserted in-test as the determinism witness). The rest
  ladder runs at HALF the stepdown (`cut_levels` at `stepdown * 0.5`) - the
  convergence knob; deeper ladders are the same call with a different
  constant. `target ∩ dex.above(z)` makes each level cut only where
  material stands, so the staircase floors close without touching the
  finished columns. Cost to change: the fraction is one line.
- **`rest_rough` rides `OpParams::Pocket3D` only** - stamped into the
  digest (a flip marks the path Stale), undoable via the existing
  EditOperationParams flow, and the generator struct
  `machining3d::Pocket3DParams` stayed untouched (ten test literals' worth
  of churn saved). v11→v12 persistence is a pure `#[serde(default)]`
  no-op step-up - old files open with the checkbox off. Cost to change:
  moving it into the generator params means touching every direct
  generator call site.
- **Grid law (`sim_of`): grid = footprint bbox, cell = min(r, stepover/2),
  each column starts at `max(stock_z, part top)`.** The raise is the
  "stock contains its model" invariant - a model standing above the
  entered stock surface is still material the sim must show standing.
  `measure` counts removal from `stock_z` (gross, the tool's verdict) and
  judges rest/gouge against the part at `tol = EPS`. Cost to change: cell
  policy is the performance knob for big models (M4), structure is sound.

## M2.1a - Mesh-driven 3D pocket (commit `7672c06`)

- **The level law is the whole design: the model is the FINAL part, and
  each level cuts `footprint ∖ material_above(z)`.** A level's target
  region is the silhouette minus the columns of solid still standing at
  that plane, so islands are computed from the mesh at every Z, never
  picked; a boss floors its own columns at its own surface (at most one
  stepdown of stair), and the last level snaps to `bottom_z` so a flat
  floor comes out exact. The slice is probed at z+ε with a 3-try nudge
  because the half-open chord law would otherwise count a plane exactly
  through a vertex as filled. Why: any other rule (section-at-z,
  picked islands, fixed ZMax ladder) either re-derives geometry the
  mesh already states or cuts into what the part still needs. Cost to
  change: it is the generator's backbone; rest-material passes (M2.1b)
  compose with it rather than replace it.
- **Descent legality is asked of the PREVIOUS cut level's center, not
  the current one** (the superset/nesting law: deeper plane ⇒ larger
  island ⇒ smaller target, so the tightest region a dive can traverse
  is the one above it). Skipped (empty) levels keep the older, deeper
  state. Why: a ramp/helix chord from prev_z down crosses only regions
  the ladder already proved open; asking the looser current level would
  dive through live wall. Cost to change: none — it's one `Option<(f64,
  Region)>`; loosening it would be the bug.
- **The ring-close is strategy-given, not inferred from the points.**
  A waterline pass is one SPIRAL of concentric rings (first point is
  the outer ring's start, last is the inner ring's), so it must be
  closed by a feed back to its first — that chord runs the 45° corner
  line and touches every ring only at corners, which no law counts as a
  crossing. A zigzag pass is an open scan: closing it would drag a
  diagonal across every row. Nothing about the point list tells the two
  apart (both end first≠last), so `walk_pass` takes `close_rings` from
  the strategy itself. Why: the original `if a != last` inference was
  wrong in both directions — zigzag diagonals spammed Crossing, and
  deleting it broke waterline's XY start/end multiset law. Cost to
  change: none; keep it a law of the strategy.
- **Verify's crossing law now separates planar from non-planar chord
  pairs**: two flat chords cross only at a shared plane (bit-identical
  to the old test, so 2.5-D goldens don't move); a pair where one
  descends flags only when their Z-intervals share positive length —
  a single-plane touch is a GRAZE of already-cut floor at the dive's
  own start/end depth, which the superset law above is what makes
  safe. Why: every 3-D entry crosses the previous level's rows at
  exactly that endpoint plane; the old closed-interval test flagged
  all 67 of them. Cost to change: the graze's safety proof would have
  to move into the generator; keep the two laws paired.
- **Helix dive point: midpoint of the longest straight run of the plan,
  membership-proved in both the previous and this level's centers
  eroded by (helix_radius + tol)**, and the swept-disc link checked to
  the entry point; any failure falls back to a plunge ("a slower dive,
  never a gouge"). The first level can only ever plunge — there is no
  shallower plane to start the descent from. Waterline + Helix
  effectively always falls back (the spiral's runs are short arcs):
  honest but worth a UI note someday. Why: "first zigzag midpoint" was
  the old shape; longest-run picks the spot the widest disc fits.
- **`material_above` is pub in machining3d and verify caches it
  (`islands_at`)**: one law, three readers (generator, gouge/shank
  island walls, M2.1b's simulation) can never drift. Cost to change:
  if the law ever parameterizes, the cache key is the (mesh, z) bits —
  revisit then.
- **An ε-grazing shelf cuts tangentially and returns `Ok`, not a
  refusal** — a block exactly filling the footprint gets its top face
  as one real path; the levels under it are all island and skip. The
  degenerate test pins it. Why: refusing would be honest-but-noisy for
  a shape that is a legal skim.
- **Ribbon went from fixed imgui pitch to a FLOW row: cells share the
  strip width, `CELL_W = 56` stands as the cap.** The 7th Create cell
  silently pushed the Simulate button off-screen at the 1280 default —
  a real product bug the kittest caught as a failed click, not a
  coordinate-math miss. Floor is 40 px, below which the row overflows
  on purpose rather than render illegible. Why: M2 adds more operation
  kinds; a fixed pitch re-discovers this cliff at 22 cells. Cost to
  change: both snapshots churn (they already churned once for the new
  cell); the layout law is `ribbon_cells` alone.
- **`OpType::Pocket3D` reuses `Icon::Pocket`** — no new asset; the 3-D
  kind is the pocket idea with computed floors, and inventing a
  near-identical glyph costs a PNG and a mental distinction nobody
  asked for. Cost to change: one asset + one `icon_of` arm when M2.1's
  siblings (adaptive, rest-rough) need their own row anyway.
- **Persistence v11 with a pure-stamp step-up** (the `pocket3d`
  ParamsDto tag rides the new enum arm; no field migration), and the
  law made explicit in `wrong_version_is_refused`: the too-new probe is
  always PROJECT_VERSION+1, so the test never rots on a bump. The v10→
  v11 round-trip test covers the grammar.
- **Test-fixture law discovered the hard way: the box's ±x walls are
  `quad(1,3,7,5)`/`quad(2,0,4,6)`** (bit0→x, bit1→y, bit2→z corner
  convention) — the diagonal-looking alternatives are diagonal PLANES
  through the cube, and a non-watertight shell slices into two lens
  chords with hollow centers, which poisoned three tests as a phantom
  "island emptiness" bug. Watertightness of hand-built facets is now
  worth checking edge-by-edge when a slice result looks wrong.
- **FTO note** (the open-questions section asks for it before M2.1):
  M2.1a ships multi-level Z machining with mesh-derived islands —
  published-literature general knowledge, nothing HEM/trochoidal in
  it. The patent-sensitive bullet is adaptive clearing (M2.1c); the
  formal review belongs there, before that code lands, not retro-fitted
  onto the pocket.

## M1.7e - CI matrix, release packaging, v0.1.0 (commit `3305468`)

- **The CI matrix is one axis: `windows-latest`, structured to widen.**
  The job runs on a `strategy.matrix.os` list so adding Linux is one
  line, but the list holds only the platform this project has proven:
  the flecs alpha bindings, the wgpu fallback adapter the GPU tests
  request, and the headless `run()` path have never been executed on a
  Linux runner. Why: "all tests green" is the bullet — a second axis
  that flakes or fails makes the CI a lie, and green over breadth is
  the Prime Directive's CI-side reading. Cost to change: run the ladder
  once on an `ubuntu-latest` box (or a WSL check locally), fix the
  fallout, add the entry.
- **0.1.0 ships as a portable zip, unsigned, no installer.** The bullet
  said "signed installer + portable zip"; we ship the zip and defer the
  rest: no Authenticode certificate is owned, and an MSI layer (WiX or
  similar) would be an unvalidated moving part in the first public
  build. The zip carries `hsmworks-ui.exe`, our `post.exe`, and the
  `assets/posts` + `assets/machines` files the CLI reads from disk —
  the whole product surface. SmartScreen may warn on first run. Cost to
  change: get a cert, add a sign step before `Compress-Archive`; if an
  installer is ever wanted it is additive, not a rework.
- **The release version comes from the binary, not from parsing
  metadata.** `post.exe --version` stamps `CARGO_PKG_VERSION` itself, so
  the packaging script splits it from the built artifact. This came out
  of running the workflow script locally before committing it: the
  first draft read `workspace_version` out of `cargo metadata` via
  `ConvertFrom-Json`, which came back *empty* under PowerShell 5.1,
  silently producing `hsmworks--win-x64.zip`. Why: the artifact we ship
  is the version's single truth — and the episode is the argument for
  smoke-testing release scripts locally, not just on the runner. Cost
  to change: none worth taking.
- **`v0.1.0` is a local annotated tag for now; `release.yml` is inert
  until the repo has a remote.** `git remote -v` shows none — the
  workflows are committed so the moment the repo is pushed the CI and
  the tag-triggered release publish themselves, but today the honest
  release artifacts are this zip under `dist/` plus the tag as the
  milestone restore point (the standing "make a restore check-in / tag"
  instruction, satisfied at each phase boundary; `pre-egui-spike` was
  the other). Discussion point: where does this repo actually get
  published?
- **Version 0.1.0 does not pre-empt the clean-room audit.** AGENTS.md:
  "Version is 0.x.0 until the clean-room audit and release" — 0.1.0
  keeps the 0.x.0 shape, and RELEASE_NOTES.md states plainly that the
  audit is still ahead. If the audit finds anything, it lands in 0.1.x
  or the next minor, not a forced renumber.

## M1.7d - G-code viewer with scroll-synced toolpath highlight (commit `98bf320`)

- **The viewer shows what the post kept, not what the file says.**
  `posting::Posted` now carries the exact program text plus a per-line
  position map out of the same engine run; the UI never re-reads the
  `.nc` file. Why: text and positions must be one artifact - if
  something edits the file afterward (or the dialog target moves),
  highlighting a line must not silently disagree with what the viewer
  printed. Cost to change: a file re-read + parse pass, and the sync
  law weakens to "probably the same file".
- **Line positions resolved app-side from the stream's own laws**
  (`viewer_map`): one Move record per path move in chain order (the
  dump's law), so the k-th Move record is the k-th global move - the
  same counter M1.7b used to seat cycles' `first_move`; a canned-cycle
  line resolves to its first expanded move. Coordinates stay
  pre-origin-shift world mm (the script applies the shift), i.e. the
  numbers the viewport already draws - a highlighted line and a
  highlighted move cannot drift apart by construction. Cost to change:
  none worth naming; this is the seam the viewer was designed around.
- **`State.post_view` is frozen evidence, unlike the sim clock.** The
  M1.7c law ("rebuild from the world every frame, no resets") applies
  to the timeline; it deliberately does NOT apply here: a program is
  the record of one specific post, so New/Open retire it, but
  in-document edits and undo leave it (it truthfully says what was
  posted, and re-posting replaces it wholesale - a refused post
  touches nothing, same gate law). Cost to change: pick which edits
  mark a viewer stale; none felt honest short of a diff view.
- **The scroll cursor is measured, not stored.** Uniform monospace
  rows (spacing zeroed, `add_sized`) let the ScrollArea clip rect's
  center line divide back to the middle row each frame - no offset
  state to drift, no per-row responses. The viewport highlight is then
  one pure resolver (`shell::gcode_segment`): previous stored position
  to current, comment lines rest the cursor, closed window shows
  nothing (hidden is display, M1.7c's law reused). Cost to change: a
  virtualized list would need the stored offset again; 2^3 lines is
  fine un-virtualized.
- **ROADMAP honesty sweep while tick-listing M1.7d**: the M1.7a/b
  bullets (validation gate, post engine + CPS, Fanuc post) shipped in
  `13eff0d`/`d30f39a` but were never ticked - done here, ✅ with
  nothing added to their text but the gate note. The table row stays
  📋 until CI and the release build (M1.7e) land.

## Regression fix — the origin anchor picker returns to the Origin page (commit `fix(ui): restore the origin anchor picker on the Origin page`)

- **What was wrong**: the 3x3 compass grid, the stock-vs-model source
  choice, the Z-level radios and the "Pick markers in viewport" toggle all
  lived in the imgui setup pane, and the egui port never carried them over
  (retired un-ported at M-g, `6071415`). `interact.rs` kept its half of the
  law intact - the marker overlay, the screen-space hit test, the
  pick-beats-entity routing - so the symptom was specifically: crosses
  never render (nothing could set `pick_anchor`) and no grid to click.
  Found by `git log -S pick_anchor`, not by code archaeology in the live
  tree.
- **Restored shape, deliberately literal**: the imgui layout ported
  one-for-one - ComboBox for the source (imgui combo), three radios for the
  level, the checkbox, and the grid with the chosen cell bracketed
  (`[SE]`) as the imgui highlight law. Alternative considered: an egui-
  idiomatic segmented control or colored highlight; kept the bracket
  because the hand-eyeballs know that look, and the parity law for
  ported panes is "same fields, same order, same echoes" (pages.rs header
  comment). Cost to change: one widget block.
- **One-law preservation**: the pane grid calls `interact::anchor_points`
  - the same function the viewport markers and the pick hit-test read - and
  a click commits through the existing `SetWcs` draft law (write drafts,
  queue the command), so grid click, marker click and *Set Origin* cannot
  disagree. A viewport pick sets `anchor_xy` and queues `SetWcs` with the
  marker's position but leaves the pane's numeric drafts to
  `sync_setup_ui`'s next pass - the imgui-era behavior, kept, not
  "fixed".
- **Pinned by** `origin_page_shows_the_anchor_grid_and_arms_pick_mode`
  (ui lib tests): grid present, click places the slot on exactly the point
  `anchor_points[8]` says, the chosen cell brackets, and the checkbox arms
  the overlay - the last one being the exact half that regressed away.

## M1.7c — move simulation: transport bar, timeline laws, tool marker (commit `feat(app,ui): move simulation - transport bar, timeline laws, and tool marker (M1.7c)`)

- **The chain is truth; cycles contribute only dwell seconds.** `sim::script`
  walks the *expanded* move list the generators already produced - the same
  geometry verify and the `.cl` goldens speak - and lets each `Cycle` add its
  dwell to the move that reaches its bottom. No second, parallel move chain
  exists to disagree with. The agreement law between the `Toolpath.cycles`
  record (the post's source of truth, M1.6) and the walk is pinned in the
  app tests: per cycle, the deepest plunge of its group equals its
  `bottom_z`, and the dwell sum rides `total` exactly. Why: a rehearsal that
  drifts from the posted program is worse than no rehearsal. Cost to change:
  the whole dwell pass lives in one function.
- **Rapids are simultaneous-axis, paced by the machine file.** Time for a
  rapid is 60 * max(|dx|/rate_x, |dy|/rate_y, |dz|/rate_z) with the rates
  read from the `.mch` kinematics tree (the X/Y pair shares the XY rapid;
  Z owns its traverse rate) - never axis-traveled and summed, never a
  hardcoded speed. The post and the timeline answer to the same setup file.
  Cost to change: one `rapid_secs`; a 4-axis machine model (M3+) would add
  feed-per-axis table lookup there.
- **The simulation rehearses the machine's program, not the picture.** The
  sim op walk mirrors the post walk exactly - every operation, hidden ones
  included; the eye-off toggle is display, not suppression. (Revises an
  earlier draft note that would have excluded hidden paths; the display
  overlay keeps its own hidden-path skip - the two lists are allowed to
  differ *because* they mean different things.) Cost to change: `sim_script`
  in `shell.rs` gains a filter the post gate would then have to duplicate.
- **The timeline is rebuilt from the world every frame, and the playhead is
  immediate-mode view state.** `Script` construction is a pure world read,
  so a document switch, a regrow or an op delete changes the program under a
  playhead that never resets - same `t`, next frame. Arming, pausing and
  scrubbing queue no command (AGENTS.md's explicit exemption for playback
  position); undo is untouched by anything the transport does. Cost to
  change: caching the `Script` by doc digest would need invalidation
  plumbing for exactly the churn this design deletes.
- **Two honesty guards, drawn not phrased**: a stalled frame's dt is clamped
  to 0.1 s so the tool never teleports through material, and past 2^20
  segments the timeline truncates with a flag the bar shows - the same
  budget law the overlay uses. Arc timing interpolates the exact sweep
  (display and verify may flatten; the clock should not).
- **Transport UI law**: the bar draws only while the ribbon cell is armed
  (snapshot churn confined to the new Inspect cell itself, both images
  updated once with that diff as the whole story); Play at the end rewinds,
  Stop leaves simulation rather than pausing at a parked end; speeds are
  1/2/4/8x multipliers on dt, never a fake clock rate; the readout verb
  (RAPID / F-value through the units lens / DWELL / END / STANDBY) is a
  pure function pinned by test. The glyph (`assets/ui/sim.png`) is original
  artwork - no Tabler motion-path glyph fit the 20 px ribbon - and the
  LICENSES.md originals section was fixed to cover `post.png` (listed as
  original in code, missing from the notice file) alongside `drill.png` and
  the new `sim.png`.

## M1.7b — in-app Post, the validation gate, Fanuc CPS assets (commit `feat(app,ui): in-app Post with the validation gate + Fanuc CPS assets (M1.7b)`)

- **Span ownership decides cycle seating in a merged stream.**
  `posting::stream_records` shifts each operation's cycle `first_move`
  by the moves posted before it (anchors are stream-global); the
  engine's `normalize_program_order` then assigns each cycle to the
  SECTION span whose move-range owns that index, and where the anchor
  index doesn't exist inside the span (a truncated or hand-made
  stream) the cycle seats at *that* span's end - never re-seated past
  a boundary. Why: a hole that can't be placed must die inside its
  own section, where the reviewer sees a hole-less section, not
  silently relocate into the next operation - cross-span relocation
  is loss. Cost to change: the law lives in `span_of` (post/mod.rs)
  plus its test table.
- **Origin-shift is the script's job: the stream speaks world
  coordinates, the program speaks machine-relative.** `dump` emits
  `OriginX/Y/Z` PARAMs (the WCS slot's Transform) and unshifted
  numbers; `fanuc.cps` subtracts the origin in `wo()` from every
  absolute word (X/Y/Z and cycle R/B) and passes the *relative*
  words through untouched - `I/J` derived as center-minus-current,
  `Q` peck steps. A legacy `.cl` has no PARAMs, so origins stay 0 and
  old goldens post byte-identical. Why: G54-relative programming is
  what a work offset *means* to the control; baking the shift in the
  engine would strip a future post of the choice to emit G10 blocks
  or take offsets from a macro variable instead. Cost to change: each
  new `.cps` must remember the subtraction - the law is a header
  comment in the shipped script.
- **The WCS origin is post context, not a generation input.** It is
  resolved at post time from the height grammar's first `WorkOffset`
  reference (else G54), and it digests into no stamp. Why: moving a
  datum changes where the machine measures from, not what is cut -
  making it stamp input would turn fixture setup into a regenerate
  storm. Cost to change: an op generated against one origin posts
  under a moved one silently, which is exactly right for 3-axis and
  worth revisiting when multi-WCS per setup arrives.
- **Tool number is library rank.** `T..`/`H..` is the tool's 1-based
  position among the *named* tools in document order - the same
  number the tool library shows. Why: one law, derived from data the
  user already sees, and the post can never disagree with the
  browser. Cost to change: reordering tools in the browser
  renumbers programs; that is what "magazine equals library order"
  means, and it's the honest version of a magazine map.
- **The gate has one body, in the app layer.** `post_setup` refuses
  stale/never-generated ops *before* building any record, refuses on
  *any* engine warning after, and writes only a clean program (and
  deletes its own half-write on an IO failure). The UI seam is two
  `CommandKind` arms and a status line - zero duplicated logic. Why:
  the Prime Directive's blocking rule - a half-posted program is the
  silent wrong answer this file exists to prevent - while the CLI
  (M1.7a) keeps its developer exit-0-with-warnings; two consumers,
  two severities, one gate computation, exactly the shape M1.7a's
  counted-warnings entry planned for.
- **Post outcomes are status-line-only, like save and open.** No pane
  error, no dialog: "posted 2 op(s), 214 lines to …" or "post
  refused - 40 warning(s): Contour1: shank/holder at move 44 …".
  Why: the file law says an effect's outcome is one line the whole
  shell agrees on; three surfaces (ribbon, Ctrl+P, tests) then read
  identically. Cost to change: a warnings pane could consume the
  same `out.warnings` vector later.
- **The seed document is honestly blocked.** The first real run of
  the gate refused `ShellUi::seeded()` with 40 ShankHit warnings -
  a full-height rim contour beside ~30 mm of uncut stock wall is
  real geometry the shank really would hit. Kept, not fixed: the
  kittest proof asserts that refusal (phase 0, nothing written),
  then makes the doc clean with a 0.5 mm top skim for the positive
  proof, then staleness, then the repost. Why: a test proving the
  gate against a fabricated document proves less. Side finding,
  commented in the test: a *stepdown* edit on a 0.5 mm skim is
  stale-by-stamp but byte-identical output - the staleness witness
  must be a field that rides the Z words (plunge feed).
- **Dialog arms are proven by queue membership.** `rfd` cannot run
  headless, so the ribbon-click test uses a no-drain frame
  (`frame_undrained`) and asserts `PostProgramDialog` was pushed;
  the `*File` arm runs the real gate in tests. Same split as
  save/open - the dialog is the only untestable millimeter.
- **gitignore scoping: vendor fixtures in, product assets out.**
  `*.cps` became `/*.cps`: the root vendor `.cps`/`.mch`/`post.exe`
  (local validator material, never committed, per the Clean-Room
  Protocol) stay ignored, while `assets/posts/fanuc.cps` and
  `assets/machines/3axis-vmc.mch` are tracked product content -
  `fanuc.cps` is an `include_str!` build dependency, and untracked
  it was a fresh-checkout build break. Why: "ours in, vendor out"
  needs the pattern anchored to the root, not the extension.
- **post.png is an original drawing.** No Tabler glyph fits "post to
  G-code", so the cell's icon is `</>` chevrons drawn in the set's
  stroke weight (40×40, round caps, alpha coverage) - the loader's
  white-repaint contract applies unchanged. Icon law kept: original
  when no generic set fits.

## M1.7a — post engine core + `.cnc` intermediate (commit `feat(app): post engine core + .cnc intermediate (M1.7a)`)

- **JS runtime: boa_engine 0.21, not SpiderMonkey** (the user raised
  SpiderMonkey on 2026-10-19 — considered, this is the answer). Why:
  boa is pure Rust — it builds in seconds on every platform our CI
  matrix will have, adds no C++ toolchain requirement, and has no FFI
  crash surface, which is a Prime Directive argument (a segfault in
  the mozjs servo crates' build or in a JS-API boundary is exactly the
  "silent wrong answer" class we refuse to ship; their Windows build
  fragility is a well-known tax). SM's real advantage is exact
  SpiderMonkey-era semantics for running *third-party vendor-style
  scripts* — which the clean-room protocol excludes by construction:
  every `.cps` in this product is ours, written against our own
  documented prelude, so engine fidelity beyond ES5 is not a
  requirement. Cost to change later: the host is one file —
  `crates/app/src/post/js.rs` is the only code that touches boa's API
  (eval-in/`to_json`-out, no captures); a SM or deno_core swap
  reimplements `Script` there and nothing else moves. Cheap insurance
  already shipped: the prelude defines `setLanguageVersion` as an
  accepted-and-ignored no-op, so a reference-era pragma line in a
  script never throws here. Revisit trigger: if we ever choose to run
  unmodified third-party posts, or posting shows up hot in simulation-
  scale batch runs.
- **The intermediate is a superset of the goldens, by parser law not
  by migration.** A stream with no `HSMW-CNC` magic parses by the
  legacy `.cl` rules, and every word accepts four spellings (bare
  positional, spaced key, joined `X1000`, separated `X:1000`), so the
  committed `.cl` goldens (all thirteen) are legal post inputs
  unchanged - the law test says so. Why: it
  makes "the real product eats its own dog food" testable in CI from
  day one - the Fanuc post must post the goldens; rewriting committed
  goldens would launder a format bug into history. Cost: the parser
  carries one classifier for all forms (~40 lines); the roundtrip law
  test pins canonical (spaced) output re-parsing to identity.
- **Legacy `; CYCLE` markers are re-seated by the engine, not the
  file.** `normalize_program_order` moves each cycle record to just
  before its `AT`-anchored move before hooks start; idempotent on
  `dump` output, which is written in program order already. Why: v3
  goldens append markers after the chain (M1.6's writer shape), and
  program order is what the hook contract means; files on disk stay
  byte-frozen while the driver sees the right order. Cost: `line_map`
  and record indices are into the *normalized* stream - documented.
- **The boa host uses a pull model: pure-JS prelude, no Rust
  callbacks.** boa's `NativeFunction::from_fn_ptr` cannot capture
  environment, so instead of shimming `writeln` in Rust the prelude
  pushes lines to a global `OUT` array and the driver evals globals
  in (`properties`, `currentPosition`, `machine`) and pulls buffers
  out (`OUT`, `MESSAGES`) as JSON. One direction per seam, and the
  whole host interface is string eval - the same shape any future
  runtime would need. Cost: one extra JSON round-trip per record;
  irrelevant at our stream sizes.
- **Nothing is silent: warnings and swallows are counted.** Stream
  `WARN` records plus every script `message()` land in
  `PostOutput.warnings`; a record swallowed by `onCommand` returning
  `false` increments `PostOutput.swallowed` (legal filtering, but the
  reviewer sees the count). The CLI exits 0 *with* warnings printed -
  it is a developer tool and the diffable program is its product; the
  in-app Post gate (M1.7b) blocks on them instead. Why: the Prime
  Directive's two consumers need two severities; one stream, one
  source of truth. Cost: the 1.7b gate must remember to fail where
  the CLI passed - planned, this is the decision it inherits.

## M1.6 — drilling: cycles, hole recognition, canned-cycle representation (commit `feat(app,ui): drilling - hole recognition, cycles, and canned-cycle representation (M1.6)`)

- **Cycles ride alongside the moves, not instead of them.** A drill
  operation generates the fully expanded chain (rapids, plunges, peck
  hops) *and* a parallel `Toolpath.cycles` list, one `Cycle` per hole
  with kind, XY, R/B/entry planes, peck, dwell and its `first_move`
  anchor. Why: the chain is the truth verify and simulation must see
  (a canned-cycle short-cut would blind the collision laws), while the
  cycle list is the truth the post must see (G81 per hole, not 40
  re-derived moves); an agreement law test pins the two views of every
  path together, and the `.cl` golden format grew `; CYCLE` comment
  lines so goldens diff the intent, not just the geometry - old
  goldens stay byte-identical because the marker is version-gated on
  "cycles exist". Cost: every drill-side change must keep both views
  consistent; the law test is the tripwire.
- **Recognition reads raw world-transformed facets, not the feature
  index.** `drilling::recognize` BFS-welds near-vertical wall facets
  (|nz| below a cosine limit) into components, circle-fits each
  (Kasa), and admits only closed rims whose XY normal span exceeds
  270°, so block sides and slot-end arcs fail the shape test by law.
  Why: features are M1.5 selection plumbing that can drift or be
  absent (mesh-only imports); holes are a geometric fact about the
  mesh and should be computed from nothing else. Cost: it re-scans the
  mesh per Detect click - fine, the button is an action, not a pass.
- **Holes are Z-axis only.** No cylindrical-axis detection. Why: the
  whole codebase is a 2.5D Z-plunge CAM; a 4/5-axis hole list would be
  unmachinable by every generator downstream. Cost: a part with side
  holes silently gets a short list - recognized as the right failure
  mode for 0.1.0, logged against the M3 axis work.
- **The hole list lives in the operation params, so it is data -
  editable, undoable, and stamped.** Detect holes queues one
  `EditOperationParams` carrying the whole `Drill` params with the new
  holes; the recognition result is snapshotted into the project digest
  so any model edit marks the op Stale rather than pretending the
  holes still match. Why: "recognition is an action, its output is
  data" is the commands-law restated; a live re-recognize per pass
  would violate it. Cost: stale ops need a re-Detect the user must
  trigger; the status line says so. An empty hole list is legal at
  creation (a fresh Drill op) and only the generator refuses (
  `GenError::Empty`), with a named reason.
- **The Auto cycle picks its shape from depth against diameter: ≤1d
  drill, ≤4d peck with a 1 mm chip-break hop, deeper a full-retract
  peck with dwell (the G83 shape); peck step 3d/1d, floored at 0.25d,
  guarded at 4096 pecks; Spot is never automatic.** Why: this is the
  textbook chip-evacuation ladder expressed in the only two numbers
  the op is guaranteed to have; auto-spotting would move the tool to a
  center-punched hole the user never asked for. Cost: an
  HSMWorks-parity "auto spot" would be a new choice arm, not a
  rewrite.
- **Constants carried in the open:** spot depth 2.0 mm, through-hole
  exit clearance 1.0 mm past the floor (the tip cone needs the
  allowance to make a full-diameter wall), dwell and peck in the
  cycle's own units, tap feed = rpm × pitch exactly. Why: each one is
  a machining convention with a real reason, not a tuned number.
  Cost: trivial to expose as params later.
- **Dwells and taps are representation-only where moves can't speak
  them.** A dwell adds no zero-length move; the chain carries no
  spindle-sync arc - the `Cycle` record holds `dwell` and the kind,
  and M1.7's post emits the P word or the rigid-tap block. Why:
  zero-length moves poison every distance-based law (feed/rapid
  length checks, kerf self-clearing). Cost: the sim timeline will
  ignore dwell time until the post exists; logged on the M1.7 list.
- **Verify learned two things for drilling:** the gouge law skips
  zero-XY-length plunges in every mode (a vertical plunge cuts
  exactly its swept disc - boundary tangency is the wrong predicate
  for it), and the shank/holder band law plus a new reach check turn
  "hole deeper than the tool" into a `ShankHit { part: true }` from
  the cycle record itself. Why: the bands already handled vertical
  moves correctly; only the two blind spots above were real. Cost:
  none - both are strictly narrower than before.
- **`tip_angle` and `pitch` are inert unless the kind reads them.**
  Tool gained both fields (`serde(default)`, drills 60<tip<180, taps
  pitch>0 in `is_sane`); profile() draws the cone tip only for
  kind=Drill. The editor seeds 118° / 1.0 mm on kind change, in an
  is_nan-guarded form so a cleared field never posts nonsense.
  Persistence stepped v9→v10 as a pure serde-default no-op - the
  step-up is the stamp itself. Cost: a future countersink kind reads
  `tip_angle` and gets the collision shape free.
- **Bore/BackBore post as their own cycles in M1.7 (G86/G89 shapes);
  thread milling stays unshipped.** Why: the milestone text asked for
  "basic cycles", and a helical thread-mill path needs circular
  interpolation the post doesn't have yet. Cost: one generator + one
  post arm.
- **Both UI snapshots churned (egui_app, egui_tool_editor) -
  intended.** The 6th Create cell shifts the Modify/Inspect group
  right by one cell width, and the tool catalog grew DR-0200/0300/
  0400/0600 + TAP-M4/M6 + BR-1000 rows. The diff images were checked to
  contain nothing else before regenerating.

## M1.5 — view cube + viewport navigation bar (commit `feat(ui): view cube + viewport navigation bar (M1.5)`)

- **The furniture is painted, not widgeted.** `viewcube::Hud` is a layout
  struct, the cube a `Painter` pass, the nav buttons painted rects with a
  hit-test - zero `egui::Window`/`Button` machinery. Why: the cube must
  be drawn through exactly the projection its pick inverts (one
  `point_screen` serves painter and pointer, so a feature that lights is
  a feature that orients), no widget graph can express that identity, and
  the kittest harness and snapshot gate can only prove in-root surfaces -
  the first floating `Window` would have been new ground twice. Cost to
  change: a real `ui.button` row for the nav bar is easy; a GPU-viewport
  cube is the expensive version nobody asked for.
- **Top-right, and it eats gestures by never arming.** The hint line owns
  the bottom-right corner, so the cube takes the top one. A press inside
  the hud acts at press time and never records into `left_press` - the
  existing release-pick and motion-promote passes then no-op on their
  own, which is how "a press on the cube must not orbit or pick" holds
  with zero new flags. Misses inside the hud are consumed too: a stray
  click between cube and buttons does nothing at all, silently.
- **Widgets outrank the raycast.** Discovered while testing: a nav button
  sits 8 px below the cube's box, but the cube's volume stands behind it
  in 3-D, so a raycast-first `click` oriented the camera when Fit was
  clicked. The law now: nav rects own their pixels first, and the cube
  raycast is gated to the cube's own box. Cost to change: none wanted;
  it's in `click()` with a comment.
- **One orientation law: `Camera::toward(d)`.** Face, edge and corner all
  classify to a unit world direction - the slab raycast's entry point,
  coordinates past 1−SNAP(0.16 cube units) counted: 1 → that face axis,
  2-3 → the sign vector. `toward` keeps `target`/`dist` (orienting never
  pans or zooms), and the poles need no special yaw because
  `basis_right`'s zero-guard pins screen-right to +X there - a law test
  holds the roll stable at six pole/yaw combos rather than trusting the
  mvp layout. Cost to change: the SNAP width is the edge/corner grab
  radius - a wider one makes faces harder to hit dead-center.
- **Fit is a command; the toggles are not.** The Fit button queues the
  same `FrameAll` the F key pushes (the nav bar's one real command);
  Iso/Wire/Paths/Axes are direct view-state writes, exactly as panes.rs
  flips the same fields - the camera/display exemption from
  everything-is-a-command, applied by the nav column's precedent. The
  command test asserts through the drain, not on a press frame: egui's
  multi-pass can run the next frame's drain before we look, so queue
  membership is pass-fragile while the executed effect is the law.
- **Vector-only glyphs.** The five buttons and the cube are drawn from
  line segments, arcs and text - no new PNGs, in step with the icon law;
  the cube's labels are the three-letter strings we already own.

## M1.3 — tangential leads for 2D contour (commit `feat(app,ui): tangential leads for 2D contour - half-arc entry parallel to the wall (M1.3)`)

- **Tangential means a half arc - a true semicircle.** `Lead::Tangential`
  `{ radius }` centers `radius` off the wall on the air normal and plunges
  at `2 * radius`: the tool starts its feed moving *parallel* to the path
  and lands on it already moving along it - G1 continuous end to end,
  which is what earns the name. The quarter arc starts its motion along
  the normal (across the air), the linear slams straight in; the three
  cover the classic lead-in families. Lead-out mirrors it: overrun
  tangentially, sweep out, stand off parallel. Cost to change: a new
  `Lead` variant - additive in the enum, on the wire (`LeadDto`, v9) and
  in the combo; removal touches every contour-params surface at once.
- **The posted sense is the quarter law's limit, not a new rule.** The
  quarter arm decides ccw from `cross((e-o), (s-o)) > 0` - the two radius
  vectors' cross, which is sin(sweep) and degenerates to exactly 0 at
  180°, where the semicircle lives. The quarter's radius vectors are
  `-R*t` and `-R*air`, so its rule factors to `-R^2 * cross(air, t) > 0`;
  the tangential posts exactly that survivor, `cross(air, t) < 0`, which
  is why the two arms agree at every sweep below π instead of inventing a
  second convention. A visible
  consequence: with `air_side`'s conventions the tangential posts CW for
  climb where the quarter posts CCW - the tests derive the expected flag
  from the law rather than pinning it, so a deliberate `air_side` change
  stays a one-place decision. Cost to change: pinning either way would
  freeze a secondary convention in a primary test.
- **Project v9, stamp-only migration.** `lead` has been a required key
  since v1, so no older file can carry the new tag - v8→v9 is the version
  step itself, like v7→v8, and every older file keeps reading with
  identical meaning. `GenStamp`'s digest gained tag byte 3 so a
  lead-kind switch marks cached toolpaths stale exactly like a radius
  edit does - file bytes are untouched by that.
- **The combo grows a fourth item sharing the arc-radius label.** Arc and
  Tangential are mutually exclusive branches and both radii mean "the
  lead arc's radius", so one `Lead arc radius` DragValue serves either -
  the label can never be ambiguous in a document. Switching to
  Tangential seeds the draft at 5.0 mm, the same shape as the Arc choice;
  the old value rides the undoable `EditOperationParams` like every other
  contour parameter.
- **The goldens say so: `contour_tangential_lead.cl` is the byte witness**
  that a half arc posts as one `S±1` arc move with the 2×radius standoff,
  and the disk-plate job is otherwise move-for-move the quarter-lead
  file - every pre-existing golden re-ran byte-identical, which is the
  law a new enum member must obey: it cannot disturb a path that never
  asks for it.

## M1.1 — document units, millimeters and inches (commit `feat(app,ui): document units - millimeters and inches everywhere including the post law`)

- **The unit is a lens, not a storage choice.** Every stored number -
  geometry, the micron lattice, toolpaths, the goldens, entity and draft
  parameters - is millimeters, always. The document's unit is one flecs
  world singleton (`schema::Units`), read at paint time through
  `units::of` and on no entity, so it never appears in a browser row or a
  saved entity list and needs no mirror in UI state that could go stale.
  This is the international inch (exactly 25.4 mm) and the
  internal-metric/display-at-the-edge pattern of CAD/CAM systems and
  G-code (`G20`/`G21`). Cost to change: storing dual representations or
  per-widget unit state - precisely what the singleton exists to prevent.
- **SetUnits is a command, and setting the unit the document already has
  is refused at construction.** The lens change is undoable like every
  other UI-visible change (its inverse writes the previous value back, so
  undo restores exactly what was on screen), and a no-op does not belong
  in the history. The control itself is a two-radio pair on the stock
  page - document-global, one place, not per-pane toggles. Cost to
  change: a silent history step, cheap to add and impossible to notice.
- **Widgets convert on a display copy with `speed ÷ 25.4`.** One physical
  pixel moves the same millimeters in either mode, so drag muscle memory
  is unit-fair; and because egui's smart-aim rounds the *shown* value
  inside a one-pixel radius, the identical ±0.1 mm aim window applies in
  both modes - the assist never favors one unit. `from_display` snaps
  inch-typed values onto the micron lattice (the same quantum as
  `cl::lattice`), so `0.5 in` stores exactly `12.7 mm` and no stored
  number ever carries float-conversion dust - the goldens keep their
  bits. mm mode stays identity: the historical DragValue, untouched.
  Cost to change: none wanted; the snap is the only rounding in the
  path.
- **Display precision keeps mm's bits and widens inches only where the
  unit demands it.** `units::len` prints the site's own millimeter
  decimals verbatim in mm mode and mm+2 decimals in inch mode (a mil is
  finer than a hundredth of a mm, so an inch readout must not lose
  information the mm one carried); feeds print bare in mm and `÷25.4` at
  two decimals in inches; areas divide twice and get +3. Every pre-existing
  string in mm mode is byte-identical - both snapshot gates passed with
  zero churn, which is the empirical proof the lens never leaked into
  storage or formatting. Cost to change: rounding in `len`, which is the
  round-trip-through-a-string bug this law exists to avoid.
- **Project file v8: an absent `units` key means millimeters.** The
  chained migration adds the key (`v7→8`), making the whole v7 corpus its
  own migration - older files reach v8 through the existing ladder, never
  skipping a step. Cost to change: a reader that defaults instead of
  migrating - rejected because the ladder is the file format's law.
- **"Correct everywhere including posts" is half specced, honestly.**
  There is no post yet (M1.7 ships the first), so nothing that exists can
  be wrong; the post's rule - convert at output time, declare the mode
  with `G20`/`G21` - is written into `app::units`' provenance header so
  the M1.7 post inherits it rather than reinventing it. Discussion point:
  confirm the Fanuc post keeps mm-internal numbers and converts per-line,
  not a whole-program mm→inch pass at the end.

## M1.4 — graphical tool editor (commit `feat(ui): graphical tool editor - its own window with a live to-scale preview`)

- **The editor is an in-app `egui::Window`, not an OS viewport.** egui's
  multi-viewport machinery (`show_viewport`) needs an OS window per
  surface - unhittable by the kittest harness, invisible to the snapshot
  gate, and unprovable by any test we can run headless. An in-app floating
  surface is the only windowing form this project can *verify*, and it
  behaves identically to the user (draggable, ✕-closeable, floats over the
  dock). The single-root-viewport law from the egui graduation stands
  untouched - this is an overlay, not a second winit window. Cost to
  change: swap `Window::show` for a deferred viewport and lose both the
  flow test and the snapshot.
- **Dock = library, window = editor - a considered revisit of this
  milestone's "standalone tool library window is gone" decision.** That
  retirement removed a *second browsing surface* duplicating the dock; the
  roadmap then asked for the editor to be "its own window". Both survive:
  the dock keeps the one library (rows, catalog, summaries), and the only
  window is the editor for one tool. The decision didn't reverse; it found
  the shape the two roadmap lines actually agree on. Cost to change:
  re-fusing editor fields back into the dock page (that's the pre-M1.4
  code - easy to resurrect, harder to keep uncramped at 280 px).
- **The preview draws `tools::Tool::profile`, and `profile` segments on
  purpose.** The side view's band breakpoints are verbatim
  `verify`'s shank/holder collision bands (cross-ref comment in
  `tools.rs`), zero-length bands skipped exactly as the checker skips
  them, and the drift test `profile_segments_match_the_collision_bands`
  fails if the picture and the checker ever disagree about where a band
  starts. One segmentation law, drawn and enforced from the same numbers.
  Cost to change: none wanted - drift here is gouge-adjacent.
- **Label ownership: the dock summary is composed text, so every field
  label resolves in exactly one surface.** `query_by_label("Diameter")`
  must never be ambiguous between dock and window - the dock shows a
  tool's numbers as three formatted `format!` lines (no widgets), the
  window owns all field labels. Buttons split the same way: "Add" is the
  catalog, "Add tool" the window's blank form, "Apply" window-only,
  "Delete" dock-only. Cost to change: any labeled widget added to the
  dock silently breaks the flow test's queries.
- **Closing is ✕-plus-ghost; no Esc binding.** The `open` mirror flips
  `State::tool_editor` to `None` on the ✕, and the ghost law mirrors
  `pane_target`'s: at the end of `drain_actions`, a window whose tool no
  longer exists (Delete, undo-of-Add, document swap) closes itself in one
  line. Esc was deliberately not wired to close - Esc must stay a no-op
  while a `TextEdit` has focus, and half-wiring it invites the bug where
  Esc-in-a-field both cancels the edit and kills the editor. Cost to
  change: one keyboard hook and a focus question.
- **`tool_editor: Option<String>` is view state on `State`, like
  `op_tab`** - never a command, never saved, never undoable; `Some("")`
  is the blank new-tool form so the "numbered past taken names" prefill
  rides `new_tool_draft` unchanged. Opening queues nothing (asserted);
  all drafting still lives in `ToolUi`, so the window reuses the
  existing sync/stage/Apply loop with zero new command surface. Cost to
  change: field relocation only.

## M1.4 — tabbed property pages (commit `feat(ui): tabbed property pages - the operation page is five named sections`)

- **Status lives above the tab bar, not inside a tab.** The stale badge and
  the folded collision warning render between the Type/Tool/Source block and
  the tabs, so a warning can never hide behind an unopened section. The
  report-visibility law outranked the tidier look of folding it into
  Geometry. Cost to change: move one block in `operation_page`.
- **The open tab is `State::op_tab`, deliberately not a field of `OpUi`.**
  `sync_ops_ui` rebuilds the drafts wholesale whenever the operation
  identity or doc version changes; a tab stored inside them would reset to
  Geometry on every Apply and every drained command - reads as a bug. On
  `State` it survives edits like the other transient view state (geo_pick,
  display mode): never a command, never saved, never undoable. Cost to
  change: one field relocation.
- **No dead tabs; an out-of-set tab falls back to Geometry.** A kind renders
  only the sections it has fields for (Trace has no Passes, non-Contour has
  no Leads & Links), and if `op_tab` names a section the kind lacks (the
  user switched the Type combo while on Leads), the page resolves to
  Geometry instead of clamping to an empty pane. The drift test asserts the
  cell is absent *and* the fallback paints. Cost to change: `has_section` +
  the one-line resolution.
- **Field-to-section placement** (the judgment call, one field per section,
  within-section order preserved from the long stack): Geometry takes the
  pick row + selection echoes, Contour's Side/Tolerance, Slot's A/B points
  and width; Heights takes every Z plane including Stepdown (a stepdown is
  a height law, not a pass count); Passes takes Stepover, Stock to leave,
  Strategy; Leads & Links takes Contour's leads and tabs only; Feeds takes
  the three feed fields. Stock-to-leave under Passes (it's how much stays
  per cut) rather than Heights. Cost to change: one `if tab ==` gate per
  group + the test table's placement list.
- **The tab bar wraps** (`horizontal_wrapped`): the properties pane is ~280
  px in the docked default, five cells do not fit on one row, and the
  M1.4-pane-width law says an overflowing widget keeps its a11y node but
  its clicks land in the wrong pane. Two tidy rows beat a clipped row.
  Cost to change: layout only.
- **The roadmap's M-c entry said "pages arrived already tabbed" - it was
  wrong and is corrected** (they arrived as one scroll; parity first). The
  redesign is this commit. Discussion point: whether the ROADMAP phrasing
  misled the hand-tests.

## M1.4 — viewport display modes (commit `feat(ui): viewport display modes - wireframe with honest hidden lines`)

- **Wireframe is a hidden-line drawing, not an x-ray.** Faces still
  rasterize - into the depth buffer only (a fourth pipeline, color writes
  off). The feature-edge wire then respects occlusion exactly as it does
  when lit: back-side lines stay hidden behind the solid. A see-through
  line soup was the cheaper build and reads as clutter on any real model.
  Cost to change: one branch in `View3D::render`.
- **The stock draws its full wire in wireframe mode** - its faces skip
  the depth pass. A stock box is a volume of material, not a surface;
  hiding its far edges behind itself would misrepresent it (and hid
  nothing real - you see through stock to plan). The two GPU tests pin
  both halves: `wireframe_paints_wire_not_faces` and
  `wireframe_hides_wire_behind_solids`.
- **Wire color is mode-aware in the shader** (`u.wire` flag, piggybacked
  in the uniform's tail padding): imgui-era dark wire is invisible over
  the dark background, so wireframe brightens it to cool gray - and lifts
  the selected-part warm tint to the hot amber the fills use. No second
  edge pipeline. Cost to change: two `select`s in `fs_edge`.
- **The toggle is browser-pane radios ("Solids: Shaded | Wireframe"),
  not a ribbon cell.** Direct view-state field flip under the same law as
  the axes/paths checkboxes - and the M-f tip table (imgui's 18-cell
  parity law) stays untouched; the ribbon has no key to promise. Radios
  over a ComboBox: the combo popup was unhittable in the kittest harness,
  and the whole choice is legible without a click - same reasoning as the
  Geometry page's pick-mode row. Cost to change: the row, the test, and
  the snapshot.
- **"Per view" read as per viewport** - this app has one viewport panel,
  so the mode lives once in `State`, like the camera. If multi-viewport
  docking ever comes, the field moves into the viewport tab's state.

## M1.4.2 M-g — imgui retired (commit `feat(ui): retire imgui - egui becomes the shell`)

- **Quit is now Ctrl+Q.** The only quit surface in imgui was its File menu;
  the egui shell has no menu. Rather than ship a migration that quietly
  loses an app-level capability, the shortcut layer gained a `Ctrl+Q →
  actions::quit` arm (same `!typing` gate as the file keys; same
  `Quit → request_quit → el.exit()` path as the window close button).
  Cost to change: one arm in `panes::shortcuts`.
- **Two actions helpers deleted, not ported:** `new_operation` (blank the
  target to show the new-op form) and `delete_operation` (menu-selected
  op delete). Both existed only for imgui menus; the ribbon's Create
  cells and Delete cell + Del key already produce identical effects
  through the same module. The `DeleteOperation` command kind itself
  stays (the Operations pane's own button pushes it, pages.rs). Cost to
  change: re-add a helper; the command law is untouched.
- **Bare `cargo run` now opens the egui window; `--ui imgui` refuses with
  rc 2** instead of silently drawing the old shell. A named refusal beats
  a fallback that no longer exists. If scripts of yours pinned `--ui
  imgui`, they now need one word changed.
- **The S0 "one wgpu" coercion test retired** (`wgpu_types_are_unified`):
  with `dear_imgui_wgpu` gone there is exactly one wgpu in the tree by
  construction - `egui_wgpu::wgpu` - and nothing left to coerce.
- **The imgui headless probe retired the same way** (`headless_frames_run`
  deleted): the egui `--headless` proof runs the same command world
  through the real `run()` entry; `tests/shell.rs` keeps the CLI-contract
  and state-law tests that were never imgui-specific.
- **Icon law: PNGs ride egui textures, vectors stay the fallback.**
  `egui_app/icons.rs` registers the same Tabler MIT glyphs via
  `ctx.load_texture` (CPU-side registration, so the kittest harness
  proves the PNG path without a GPU); every consumer checks the texture
  first and paints the vector twin when it's absent. Layout is
  GPU-independent by construction - the ribbon geometry matches imgui's
  own formula (CELL_H 35, RIBBON_H 61) rather than the spike's squeezed
  49px strip. Cost to change: none - this is how Rerun-scale apps do it.


## M2.2e stage E — the two surface-finish numbers (code `bf92a64` + this docs)

- **The staircase halts AT the floor, not past it.** The refinement
  guard is `delta > delta_min`, with halving `(delta·0.5).max(delta_min)`
  and growth `(delta·2).min(delta0)`. No chord shorter than the floor
  is ever emitted; before the clamp, one halving rung could dip under
  the floor and grow back, making the number a suggestion.
- **A floor past cruise is inert, and we keep it that way rather than
  refuse it.** Growth caps at `delta0 = scallop_stepdown(r, tol)`, so
  every floor past the cruise step plateaus: 1.2 mm and 4.0 mm produce
  byte-identical paths on the witness. Discussion item: `validate()`
  could warn that the number is above the march's own coarsest step —
  it contradicts nothing, so today it just stands unused.
- **The edges are floored by nobody.** The bisections that find where
  a run starts and stops answer to the material, never to a spacing
  parameter — the witness pins the entries equal across every floor.
  A minimum step is the machinist's number about cutting; piece
  boundaries are the model's.
- **Waterline ignores both numbers, byte for byte.** min_step lives in
  the march (the raster families), ramp_angle in the serpentine
  connector; the rings never route through either.
- **ramp_angle default = 45°, v17's gift spelled.** Shallow ground
  was already exactly the ground whose support climbs no steeper than
  one in one, so writing the law down changes no behavior — every
  pre-v18 path is byte-identical. Links that barely traverse
  (`d_xy ≤ tol`) are the vertical case the ramp law already settles;
  the gate stays inert there by design.
- **The corrugated-fold story the drafts told was wrong in
  mechanism.** A crease on faceted ground is a validity GAP (the
  tangent centers of the two facets are separated by the fold), not a
  straddle the chord law bites on: the march refuses past the gap and
  edge-bisects to the exact crease. What a floor truncates is the
  staircase of approaches INTO those gap edges — real, measured (136
  short chords → 70 → 48 as the floor rises), but not the "fold sinks
  a chord by sag(h)" picture the first drafts asserted. The dome is
  the other disqualified witness: every center is self-shadowing
  there (mid-valid, dev≈0), so min_step is provably inert on domes —
  a property of the law, worth a manual paragraph someday.
- **Float law for CAM asserts:** the test compares run entries at
  1e-4 mm, not byte-wise — bisection brackets are seeded from the
  sample grid, so a floor perturbs an entry's LAST BITS (2e-8 mm)
  while the boundary it converges on never moves. `assert_eq` on raw
  floats would have been testing IEEE, not CAM.
- **Wire v18, both halves honest:** `min_step` is skip-if-None (an
  option like stepover — None must not mint a key); `ramp_angle` is
  always written (like the hop plane — a default is a fact about the
  machine). A v17 file migrates to exactly what v17 ran: no floor,
  45°.

## M2.3 stage A — the program material sim and its two truths (code `8199322` + this docs)

- **The program sim chains cached ops in order; it never re-plans them.**
  The truth of what the machine will do is the posted toolpath, not a fresh
  re-derivation from parameters - a sim that re-planned could disagree with
  the .cl that ships. One judgment, at the end, over the ops as cached: that
  is the post gate's input shape (stage D) and the viewer's (stage B).
- **Deviation is located, not just counted.** The worst rest cell and the
  worst gouge cell carry an XY *and the sim's Z at that column* - the
  warning a user jumps to must name the place, and the place includes the
  depth the sim actually reached. Counting-only would send the viewer to a
  cell that averages nothing.
- **NaN is the no-verdict column, never a zero.** Where the stock never
  stood (outside a cylinder's round) or where the model has no surface (air
  in the part), the deviation field reads NaN and carries no verdict; a
  dressed-up zero would color-map as a clean bill of health on columns that
  were never in play. Determinism includes the NaN pattern - the color map
  redraws this field every frame and two runs must agree to the bit.
- **One atom law per tool shape.** Ball ops take the exact sphere sweep;
  flat ops take the exact disc at every station, which is exact for end
  mills and for drills and taps - the final hole IS the cylinder. The
  bull-nose corner is the one known-biased atom: the disc reads at the
  corner's lowest point, so beside a fillet wall the sim over-reports
  removal (under-reports rest). It is stated at the `SimOp` type, not
  hidden; when it matters the viewer says so. Discussion item: whether
  stage B paints fillet-adjacent rest as "unknown" rather than trusting
  the optimistic zero.
- **`simulate` validates everything before touching anything.** Two
  passes: op radii finite-positive and every move coordinate finite first,
  subtraction second. A half-run grid that looks like a sim is the silent
  wrong answer wearing a lab coat - the Prime Directive in this kernel's
  own clothes. A refusal leaves the stock exactly as it stood; op 2's
  poison cannot run the program.
- **Subtraction is monotonic, so rest has one meaning: "never reached."**
  Nothing leaves a plateau by cutting HIGH; rest can only be the program
  not arriving. This law nearly went untested: the first witness tried to
  show rest with a disc plunge that "left a plateau" - physically
  impossible, the plunge ties the untouched slab top and the located max
  landed on a far corner instead. The honest witness is a face traverse
  that stops short of its own margin; the fixer op then erases the rest
  while the gouge stands - rest and gouge have opposite time-arrow
  semantics and the test says so.
- **`auto_cell` IS envelope_scan's lattice, one law in one place** (an
  eighth of the smallest tool radius, a 100 um floor, grown to keep any
  span under 1024 columns) - a second "reasonable voxel size" function
  would drift by the next refactor.
- **`from_shape(FromModel)` refuses at build with the right answer in its
  words** ("model stock builds from its facets: Dexel::from_facets") - the
  facets live in the world, not in the enum's numbers; quietly boxing the
  model would add stock the user never chose. Degenerate meshes (empty,
  XY-flat, non-finite vertex) refuse too, and `from_facets` carries one
  cell of margin so the model's own bbox corners read air, never mystery
  material.
- **Caught on the ladder, not by the bump:** the v17→v18 wire bump left
  `wrong_version_is_refused` asserting v18 as a FUTURE format - a lying
  fixture HEAD carried unnoticed (the stage E suite log truncated before
  its binary). Moved to v19; the migration list in its comment now names
  v17→v18.

## M2.3 stage B — the viewer judges the program (code `8fb7aaa` + this docs)

- **The sim's gate IS the post's gate, by construction.**
  `simulate_document` validates through `posting::program_ops` - not a
  copy of its rules - so the error a user sees under the Deviate cell
  is byte-for-byte the error the Post would give (`missing_pieces_
  refuse_by_name` asserts `err == same`, not a paraphrase). Two gates
  that must agree is a drift bug waiting to be merged; one gate read
  twice is a law. This is also the shape stage D's blocking gate
  inherits.

- **Refusal ordering is load-bearing, and the tests encode it.** The
  planned-ops gate runs BEFORE the sim's own stock laws, so a rotated
  or moved stock first reads "inputs moved since generation -
  regenerate" (staleness, a setup truth) and only a FRESH rotated
  stock earns "the program sim models an axis-aligned stock". Writing
  these tests backwards (rotate, don't regenerate, expect the axis
  refusal) would have asserted the wrong refusal - the test suite now
  documents which law speaks first.

- **"no stock defined" is reachable only through an op that never
  reads the stock.** Any stock-sourced op goes stale at stock removal
  and the gate refuses first - so the witness is a model-sourced
  contour with fixed heights. A refusal with an unreachable trigger
  would rot unnoticed; the test keeps the code path honest.

- **Box stock is XY-centered, and the fixture law fell out of a
  failing test.** `Dexel::from_shape(Box)` spans `-dx/2..dx/2` (the
  mesh agrees), so a model box at `0..60` next to a stock at the
  origin judges HALF NaN columns - not a bug in either, a fixture
  lying about the world. `faced_doc` now centers the model on the
  stock's placement; the lattice shift moves with `Location.pos` and
  the twins test (`the_lattice_moves_with_the_stock`) pins that moves
  stay world millimeters - the same numbers the viewport draws -
  while the GRID is what translates.

- **DEV_TOL is a display law, not an authoring tolerance.** 10 um: the
  finest scallop the shipped lattice resolves visually. An op's own
  tolerance is what its generator promised; the map answers "what
  stands after the WHOLE program". Re-using op tolerances would let a
  tolerance edit recolor columns another op generated. Discussion
  item: whether the Release 0.2.0 story wants DEV_TOL surfaced as a
  user-settable "display sensitivity" or stays a constant.

- **The verdict bar is one pure string.** `actions::deviate_readout`
  builds the sentence (counts, mm³, worst depth, the located XY and
  the SIM's z there - `at.z` is the dent floor or the standing
  layer's top, never the model's nominal); the status line, the bar,
  and the tests all read the SAME function, and the ui test pins its
  shape without a GPU. A missing WHERE prints "?" - an honest gap,
  never a fabricated coordinate.

- **The sheet takes the stock's slot in draw order.** While Deviate is
  armed, the judged surface IS the stock's appearance (same translucent
  blend law, class-colored: steel / amber rest / red gouge / gray
  never-judged) - drawing both would only let the untouched solid veil
  the verdict. Retirement is the PostView law: `program_sim` is frozen
  evidence, view state, never a command, never saved, retired by any
  document switch - a verdict about the old world must not survive
  into a new one.

- **Hidden models still judge.** The deviation field compares against
  every model entity's facets; the browser eye only hides geometry
  from the viewport, not from the program's contract. Silently
  excluding hidden parts would let one click make a gouge vanish from
  the verdict. Discussion item: an explicit "include in verification"
  checkbox per model, if users ever want geometry that's reference
  only.

- **Icon reuse: Deviate draws the Stock glyph until a dedicated one
  is chosen.** No asset was invented mid-stage (original-glyph rule
  wants a design pass, not a rush job); the stock icon is exactly the
  noun the cell judges.

## M2.3 stage C — the machine speaks (code `b8114b9` + this docs)

- **The unstated-limit law, and why zeros are not limits.** Vendor
  `.mch` files carry `0` for every rate nobody configured; a zero
  rapid speed does not mean the machine cannot rapids - it means the
  file doesn't say. So 0/absent/non-finite reads `None` and checks
  nothing; only stated numbers can be violated. The alternative -
  treating a blank as a ban - would refuse every real file on earth.
  Travel bounds are the exception with a reason: a `NaN` or inverted
  stroke is nonsense, so it reads as corruption (is_sane), not as
  freedom.

- **Format reuse is what the user authorized; values stay ours.** The
  `.mch` JSON layout is parsed as HSMWorks writes it (general,
  kinematics, synced_configuration) - the CPS/MCH re-spec named the
  formats, not the numbers. Every fixture value here is invented
  (TestMill 1, Hsmworks Testbench), per the clean-room protocol; the
  module's provenance line says so.

- **Stroke lives in a `"travel"` object we add to linear parts.** The
  real format states velocities but no travel anywhere we could find
  in the public behavior notes - a machine without a stroke makes
  travel checking impossible, so the layout grows one extension
  (our own key, ignored by anyone else's reader). Axis numbers are
  PROGRAM coordinates: the check subtracts `posting::wcs_context`'s
  origin - the post's own origin law, one copy - so a G54 slide
  shifts what passes exactly as it shifts the G-code.

- **Axes are looked up BY NAME.** The table is ordered by the
  controller's `coordinate` field for display, but a positional
  index would silently check the wrong stroke the moment a file
  names a subset or leads with a U. Names make a limit mean
  something.

- **The feed bill is per-move and directional.** Only a move that
  actually drives an axis pays that axis's `max_normal_speed`; the
  ceiling is the SLOWEST stated among the driven ones, unnamed when
  none states one. Rapids: programs never ask for a rapid rate, so
  `max_rapid_speed` is carried but unbilled today - and rapids
  still pay the travel bill, which is the one that crashes
  machines. Arcs are judged at endpoints + the four XY quarter
  points; that can over-report a real stroke on a back-sweep arc,
  never hide a violation - over-reporting is the honest direction.

- **Tool length means gauge length.** The magazine's
  `max_tool_length` measures spindle nose to tip: flute + shank +
  holder, not the cutter alone - the number a tool table really
  gates. Spindle: today every op posts its tool's rpm, so the tool
  IS the program's spindle word; when per-op speeds arrive the
  checker reads them there.

- **Report, not block - yet.** Stage C's verdict joins the Deviate
  sentence ("; machine: within limits" / "N limit problem(s)") and
  refuses nothing at the post; the unstated-limit law's sentence
  half: no machine mounted, no claim printed. Stage D moves the same
  `check_document` into `post_setup`'s path, where the shared-gate
  law says it judges exactly what would post.

- **v18→v19 is the step-up pattern again**: pure serde-default on the
  `machine` key, so an old file loads byte-comfortably and a new save
  mints no key until a machine is actually loaded. A corrupt travel
  statement makes the WHOLE load a Corrupt refusal that mounts
  nothing - refuse-before-world-write, proven by test.

- **Discussion item - the scallop test's debug-profile cost.**
  `scallop_crosses_the_diagonals_and_measures_clean` runs ~1.9 s in
  release but 1853 s (31 min!) unoptimized - it passes either way,
  but a debug `cargo test` on the whole suite becomes impractical.
  Candidates: a `#[cfg(debug_assertions)]` coarser resolution for
  that one fixture, or an `#[ignore]`d slow group. Decided: ship C
  untouched (the law it pins is release-verified); fix in the 0.2.x
  maintenance window.

## M2.3 stage D — the verdict holds the door (code `e158b88` + this docs)

- **What blocks is unsafety, not incompleteness.** The gate refuses on
  GOUGE cells (the program cuts below the model's final geometry - the
  Prime Directive's "never", located) and on stated machine-limit
  violations. REST material does NOT: a roughing program posts on its
  promise of a later finish op, and a gate that blocked rest could not
  express a multi-op shop workflow at all. The intent-vs-safety split
  is the whole design: Deviate informs on both truths, the gate guards
  only the safety one. Discussion item: whether Release 0.3 wants a
  per-project "no rest at final op" authoring option, if users start
  treating the sim as a part-completeness check.

- **A refusal-to-judge is never a judgment.** When `simulate_document`
  cannot run (no stock, rotated stock), the gate contributes no line -
  absence of evidence is not evidence of danger. The net under this
  path is the per-op WARN gate, which has always been the load-bearing
  one; the stage-B law (the sim's gate IS the post's gate) plus this
  one means the program-level sim is an EXTRA net, honestly silent
  when it can't speak. The Deviate cell states its reason on demand.

- **Evidence at post time, never cached.** The gate re-runs the checks
  inside `post_setup` instead of reading `state.program_sim` - the
  PostView law ("a verdict about an older world must not survive into
  a new one") applied where it actually matters: metal. The cost is
  one sim pass per post (seconds on big programs); the alternative is
  a staleness footgun on the exact thing the release exists to
  prevent.

- **Order is law again.** `stream_records` (freshness, by name) refuses
  BEFORE the gate's sim runs - judging stale moves would print
  located-where over an old world, the one thing located verdicts must
  never do. The existing stale/post tests pin that ordering; the new
  gate could not have been appended after the engine run either, since
  the warnings check already owns "post blocked - ...".

- **The machine clause names the model** ("machine TestMill 1: 1 limit
  problem(s): ...") - in the refusal you are reading a claim about a
  specific machine, and people own more than one. The ui's sentence
  test (`the_machine_gate_refuses_the_post_by_name`) pins the whole
  status string through the real shell, so the law is checked where
  the user reads it.

- **No ui code changed in stage D** - the refusal rode the existing
  "post refused: {err}" arm untouched. A gate that needs new shell
  plumbing to be obeyed was never a gate.

## M2.3 stage E — Release 0.2.0 close-out (this docs + the tag)

- **One version, one bump.** The workspace root carries it; `hsmworks-ui`
  and `post.exe` inherit - the release.yml version-from-binary law reads
  `post.exe --version`, so the zip's name cannot drift from the tree it
  was built from. 0.1.0→0.2.0 is a Cargo.toml one-liner.

- **Notes are a document, not an archive.** RELEASE_NOTES.md leads with
  what's new since 0.1.0 and keeps a cumulative "What works" - the old
  0.1.0 prose is a pointer to the tag, not a second section to maintain.
  The goal of the rewrite: a reader can decide "can I do my work with
  this?" in one page.

- **What 0.2.0 does NOT claim.** Phase 2 is not fully green: M2.2's
  surface-finish parameters are still open (that row stays ⚠️), and the
  release story is "trust before cutting", not "3D complete". The M2.3
  row is ✅ because all five of ITS bullets shipped; fixtures-vs-collision
  was deferred to M3.2 by stage B's law, not silently dropped.
  Discussion item: a short 0.2.x maintenance pass to close the M2.2 tail
  before M3.1 starts, since associativity touches the same ops.

- **The publish path is still unproven.** There is no git remote yet
  (carried from the 0.1.0 era): the `v*`-tag trigger in release.yml has
  never run on a runner. The tag is cut locally; the first push will be
  the actual test of the packaging script. Discussion item: create the
  GitHub repo and push `main` + `v0.2.0` when the user is back.

## M4.2 — the multi-platform gate and the GPU pick (code `feat(ui): ... (M4.2)` + this docs)

- **The pick is flag-first, env-second, refuse-always.** `--gpu-backend
  dx12|metal|vulkan|gl` wins over `CAMCRAFT_GPU_BACKEND`; a bad name in
  either source exits 2 naming what it got, before any window opens —
  the `--ui` refusal shape, and the Prime Directive's "validate early"
  applied to startup. The chain then runs preferred → `PRIMARY` auto →
  `Backends::all()`, each miss logged with the backend it names, so a
  driver blacklist workaround can be read off the console line. The
  `wgpu::DownlevelFlags` machinery this bullet originally specced is
  gone from wgpu 30 — the honest tier signal now IS the backend: a `gl`
  answer logs "conservative feature set" because GLES is wgpu's own
  second tier.

- **Headless stays pinned to the fallback adapter on purpose.** The
  gates' determinism law outranks the new flag there: `--headless`
  prints one line ("pins the fallback adapter... pick ignored") rather
  than silently accepting or silently ignoring. Discussion item: whether
  the pixel-snapshot goldens should ever run against a named backend.

- **Linux: compiles green natively (WSL2, rustc 1.99) and runs the
  suites — with one honest blemish: `finish3d_project_dome` and
  `finish3d_radial_dome` emit 2 moves fewer on Linux.** Measured, not
  guessed: identical file except three near-duplicate points at
  (-2826..-2660, -8869..-8940, 8714) collapse to one when the dedupe
  cull runs on glibc's sin/cos instead of the Windows CRT's — a ULP
  wobble in the dome's angular sampling landing exactly on the cull
  threshold. Every other golden, posting, fanuc_post, roundtrip and the
  gpu tests are byte-green on both platforms. Chosen interim law: the
  CI parity job `--skip`s those two BY NAME (never silently) and
  `M4.2b` owns the fix — quantize to microns BEFORE the cull decision
  so platform libm cannot choose how many moves the shop gets.
  Considered and dropped: per-platform goldens (two truths),
  vendoring a deterministic libm for the generators (heavy until M6.1
  makes GPU math the sampling source anyway). The GUI itself is still
  unproven to RUN on Linux (needs a real display+GPU box); Docker
  Desktop on this machine died mid-milestone (its program tree
  vanished — WSL carried the Linux lane instead), so the "Dockerfiles
  for every target" bullet is M4.2's one open rung. Discussion items:
  M4.2b now vs at 0.4.0; a fresh Docker setup to retire the last one.

- **macOS is now a CI claim, not a local one.** The build job adds
  macos-latest (check + goldens + split-crate tests); nothing of ours
  ever compiled for Darwin here. First green run is the proof; expect
  one round of fixes at most (the stack — wgpu metal, flecs clang, winit
  cocoa — is all first-party cross-platform).

- **WASM: the compute core speaks it; the app does not.** geometry/cl/
  post compile clean for `wasm32-unknown-unknown` (post needed only the
  getrandom `wasm_js` target-dependency; boa_engine handles the rest).
  The app/UI half would be a wgpu-via-webgl shim + flecs-on-wasm story
  — that is the web-sys-mvp rung's work, not M4.2's; the CI wasm job
  pins what is true today so a regression in the core's portability
  fails loudly.

## M4.3 — the debrand rename: what moved, what stayed, why (code
`refactor: rename hsmworks to camcraft across crates, cps posts and
tooling (M4.3)` + this docs)

- **The law, and its one limit.** "Nothing carries the old brand" is
  enforced for everything that is *naming our product*: crate/package
  names (`camcraft-*`), the binary (`camcraft-ui.exe`), the project
  extension (`.camproj` + filter + `untitled.camproj`), the window
  title ("CamCraft"), the cps `vendor` line ("CamCraft (independent,
  unaffiliated)", `nm` fallback "CAMCRAFT"), the dist zip name, the
  import thread name, doc-comment self-references, workspace and CI
  flags. What names *Autodesk's product* in a true statement ("a
  clean-room implementation of HSMWorks", "no HSMWorks source was
  consulted", "HSMWorks-style From") is the trademark-disclaimer
  posture the repo was built on and stays verbatim - a rename that
  erased those sentences would erase the provenance law itself.

- **Wire magics stay `HSMW-CL`/`HSMW-CNC` - considered and kept.** The
  brand's initials survive in exactly two places: the first line of
  the CL dump and CNC intermediate formats. A format signature is a
  compatibility contract, not a logo: every committed golden, every
  `.camproj` with an embedded stream, and every `.cnc` file on a
  shop floor is keyed on it. Renaming would orphan all of it (the
  parser's fallback is *absence* of magic → legacy `.cl` rules, not a
  second spelling), buy zero user-visible debranding, and churn 21
  goldens the suite's stability law protects. The parser keeps one
  canonical spelling per format; if a `CAMC-*` ever ships it will be
  a versioned format decision, not a brand sweep. `docs/CNC-
  INTERMEDIATE.md` documents the tokens as what they are: names from
  the pre-rename era of our own format.

- **Hash salts moved, and the churn is the mechanism.**
  `hsmw-op-stamp-v2`/`hsmw-rest-*` → `camcraft-*`. The op stamp rides
  in saved projects, so every document saved pre-rename reads Stale
  once on open and clears on regenerate - the identical, documented
  behavior of a stamp-version bump (the `b3eaebc` precedent; stamp.rs
  now carries the note), visible in the UI, never silent. The
  alternative (parking a wrong brand in a hash because it *might*
  cause a regeneration) trades a trademark concern for a comment that
  lies about what the bytes are.

- **Test fixtures renamed too** ("CamCraft Testbench" vendor,
  `camcraft-posting-`/`camcraft-gone-` tmp names): fictional-vendor
  strings are ours to name, and a fixture is exactly where a stray
  brand re-enters the greps forever. One law test needed a real fix,
  not a rename: `fanuc_post::tilted_move_...` asserted the no-angle-
  word law with `!program.contains('A')` - harmless while the old
  brand had no A; "CAMCRAFT" has two. The assertion now checks what
  the law states: no `A` adjacent to a digit/sign, so prose in
  header comments cannot trip it (the test's intent, made exact).

- **Docs discipline: ledgers keep era names.** Completed ROADMAP rows
  and older RECOMMENDED entries keep the names they were written with
  (`cargo test -p hsmworks-app` in an M2.3-era line is history, not
  branding); operational files (AGENTS.md family, doc titles, gate
  commands) were swept. Re-writing history entries after a rename
  falsifies the decision record - the record is what the post-roadmap
  discussion reads.

## Phase 5 — the plan and its three shape decisions
(this docs + `docs/M5-PHASE5-PLAN.md`; code follows from M5.0's first commit)

- **M5.0 exists because Phase 5 is a kind-flood, and the code told us so.**
  The seam map measured one operation kind riding 14 files (52
  `OpParams::Finish3D` sites - the type enum, five semantic fns, the stamp
  tag, heights, material, generate dispatch + verify-mode + context,
  HeightRefs, setup sheet, project DTO twice, retype + quick params, five
  pane tables, three page dispatches, the command arm). M5.1/M5.2 name ~25
  kinds: same-channel growth is ~350 edit sites, and every one is a place
  the silent-wrong-answer can hide in maintenance. The user's standing
  shape law - low coupling, high cohesion - makes the prelude not
  optional. What was considered and dropped: trait-object params (fights
  the Rust-owned-component law and moves dispatch into vtables nobody can
  grep); per-family crates now (premature - the families are inside
  motion's generators and app's tables, the crate seams the plan names are
  where they already want to live).
- **The tool axis is a vector below, angles above.** `cl::Move` gains
  `axis: Option<[f64;3]>` (workpart frame); the app converts vector→`A/B/C`
  against the mounted machine's rotary directions - one function, machine-
  dependent (trunnion B/C vs tilting head have different solutions), with
  shortest-travel unwrapping; the stream/post contract stays exactly
  stage-D's (keyed millidegrees, tip-positioned XYZ, refuse-by-name on an
  unreachable tilt). Vector-up angles would bake one machine's kinematics
  into the geometry layer; angles-down from app keeps motion world-blind -
  the R4 law again. post/mod.rs's hardcoded `abc: None` gets its producer
  when M5.1-A lands, and the five-dialect refusal test already guards the
  seam end to end.
- **Scripting is JS on the engine we already ship.** The open question
  ("QuickJS / Lua / Rust-native DSL", and M5.3's "TypeScript bindings")
  resolves to boa_engine: one embedded runtime, already sandboxed under the
  post contract's rules, already in the tree; TS consumability rides the
  typed JSON the batch API speaks. A second interpreter (Lua) would be a
  second sandbox to audit for a product that must never run user code
  unsafely - considered, dropped. ROADMAP's "Lua" word on the M5.3 ledger
  row is superseded by this entry when M5.3 is planned for real.
- **M4.2b rides M5.0, not a solo commit**: the fix is one sampler touching
  cull decisions, and M5.0 regenerates nothing else - the two named CI
  skips retire in the same close-out that proves the structure split kept
  every golden byte-stable.
  *Superseded by the M4.2b entry below: it landed solo, and first.*

## M4.2b — the dome drift was a tie, not a rate (code `fix(motion,cl): quantize the 3D-finish scan, hull and arc splits off the platform's libm (M4.2b)` + this docs)

- **Root cause, measured, after two wrong hypotheses.** The M4.2 note
  said "ULP drift in the sampler's sin/cos lands near-duplicate points
  on the cull threshold" - wrong on both halves. Ring dumps (a temporary
  probe, since removed) showed the two platforms emit different VERTEX
  COUNTS for the same z-level loop: Windows 222, Linux 220, with exactly
  the three golden-adjacent vertices fused into one. The drift lives in
  `facet_polygon`'s argmax: the scan point for one facet is the best of
  at most six support candidates (3 vertices + 3 edge-stationary
  points), and on a facet with an edge perpendicular to the scan
  direction - which latitude-band facets are, everywhere - the vertex
  and edge supports are EXACTLY equal in mathematics. The winner is
  then decided by the last bits of each libm's cos/sin, and since the
  candidate's point carries `rho·u` with a different `u`, the hull's
  dedup (`==`) and cross-product (`<=0`) decisions flip: three
  near-collinear points survive on Windows, fuse on Linux. Culling is
  not the culprit; nothing reaches a "threshold" - the polygons
  themselves differ before the cull ever sees them.

- **Fix by construction: the decision surface contains no floats.**
  Scan points are snapped to the micron grid the moment they are born
  (`lattice` = the same 1e6 grid as the geo2d bridge's SCALE, so the
  bridge's round is a fixpoint and the union sees identical integers on
  every platform); the support value is compared on the grid; and
  `convex_hull` runs in exact i64/i128 - map to grid ints, sort, dedup,
  Andrew's chains with i128 cross products, map back as `x as f64 /
  1e6`. A 1000 mm part is 1e9 units, products fit i128 with room to
  spare; saturating casts keep nonsense input finite (Prime Directive).
  Tie-breaking is now candidate ORDER, identical on every target. The
  march-sampler lattice fix kept from the first pass remains - it is
  still true that every march sample lands on the grid, now asserted by
  the `every_march_sample_lands_on_the_micron_lattice` law test.

- **Law override - the goldens were regenerated, against the letter of
  the owed fix.** Both the M4.2 note and this file's Phase-5 entry said
  "regenerate nothing". That proved impossible: the committed Windows
  goldens encode Windows' tie-bits at those mathematically-exact ties,
  so any platform-invariant generator must move them. Seven files were
  rewritten, all COARSER by sub-µm slivers (radial_dome 1982→1958,
  project_dome 560→536, waterline_cone 121→113, the four plateaus −8
  each): the removed moves are near-collinear vertices the exact hull
  fuses. The tolerance proof is the heavy lane, not an argument - all
  27 ignored finish3d measurements and both app envelope verdicts pass
  in release, and fit_arcs' chord-deviation law bounds the cut
  regardless of which candidate the old tie chose. Linux parity was
  then VERIFIED, not assumed: the same 20 goldens, 20/20 on
  Ubuntu-24.04, and both named CI `--skip`s are retired in the same
  commit.

- **The two ceil sites stayed fixed anyway, orthogonal to the dome.**
  `machining2d::fit_arcs`' segment count and `cl::arc_chords`' chord
  count both divided by libm-derived quantities where a mathematically
  clean result (2π, an exact multiple) arrives as 2±1 ULP - `ceil` of
  that is a platform coin flip for EVERY closed ring and arc, waiting
  for its own drift story. The idiom is `(lattice(q) + 1e-12).ceil()`:
  the lattice swallows the accumulated noise, the epsilon biases
  UPWARD so a fix can never remove a chord Windows had - over-splitting
  is the safe direction (more, shorter arcs, same deviation bound).
  The probes showed these two did not contribute to the dome drift;
  they are kept because they remove real knife-edges, proven
  goldens-identical on Windows.

- **Solo, and before M5.0.1 - reversing the Phase-5 note.** The plan
  said M4.2b rides M5.0's close-out; it landed first instead, because
  M5.0.1's law is "goldens byte-identical across the split" - that law
  cannot be tested against a sampler whose output is a platform coin
  flip. A drifting generator under a byte-identity law means every
  split's green gate is luck, so the drift had to die before the file
  moves started. The two CI skips retire now rather than at M5.0's
  close-out - the skips were the debt's receipt; keeping them past the
  proof would hide it.

## M5.0.1 — the seven file splits: how a split stays honest (commits 4463808..4bf5e4d + this docs)

**Splits were mechanical slices, never retyped code.** A python splitter
read each flat file, found top-level item seams (an item plus its
contiguous `///`/`#[…]` lines; block end = the next head's start), and
emitted the directory module: original top-level `use` lines on every
file's head, items moved verbatim, inline `mod tests { }` de-wrapped with
its `#[cfg(test)]` attr hoisted to a `mod tests;` decl in mod.rs. Same-
named items (a struct plus its impls) were addressed by `Name@line`
when name matching alone couldn't assign them. Why: the stage law is
"structure only, goldens byte-identical" - a hand-move invites a drive-by
edit that a green suite may not catch, and a slice guarantees the moved
lines are the same bytes. Cost to change: none - the layout is normal
Rust modularity; the tooling was scaffolding.

**Private items became `pub(super)`, the pub surface re-exported from
mod.rs.** Callers, tests, and docs see exactly the paths they saw
before. Trait-impl items stayed plain (a visibility on `fn fmt`/
`fn from` is E0449), cross-file struct fields promoted only where a
sibling file touches them. `pub(crate)`-everywhere and `pub`-everywhere
were both considered and dropped: wider than the seam needs is a
coupling loan at the exact interest rate Phase 5 is here to pay down.

**Two files rode past the ~400 cap, on purpose.** `drilling/tests.rs`
sits at 408 - eight lines past the mark; cutting the fixture helpers
mid-block would have traded eight lines of slack for two more seams to
audit. `verify/engine.rs` is ~415 with the whole (a)-(f) law cascade in
one function: splitting a function body is behavior work, and this stage
forbids behavior work; its natural seam arrives with M5.1-F's law-engine
pass. Both exceptions are structural, not budgetary - re-audited at the
close ladder, goldens unchanged, suite green.

**One `tests.rs` per module, not tests scattered onto the domain files.**
The coverage law (count `#[test]` before and after, keep the ignored
lane's goldens) is a one-command check this way, and each suite's
Gate-map header stayed where its reader expects it.

**The close-out ladder got one correction worth keeping:** the
"fresh binaries" find also matches `deps/camcraft_ui.exe` - the app's
hardlink, not a test harness. Run it with test flags and it opens the
GUI and waits forever; the serial UI lane silently hung on it twice.
The lane now takes its binary list from `cargo test -p camcraft-ui
--no-run`'s `Executable` lines (seven hashed binaries, run serially with
CWD=`crates/ui` per the snapshot-golden law).

**Measured, not copied: coverage is 793, not 792.** The ROADMAP M5.0
stage row says "Coverage 792==792" - the honest count across bb0017c..
HEAD is `git grep -c "#\[test\]"` = 793 before and after all seven
splits (29 `#[ignore]` likewise - my "31" here was a miscount, corrected
in the M5.0.2 close; the law is the before==after comparison, which held
under either count), the +1 ride-along from M4.2b's probe tests. The
stage row gets corrected when M5.0 itself closes.

## M5.0.2 — the kind registry: one table, and what deliberately stays a match (commit c465558)

**A const `KindInfo::ALL` table, not a `define_ops!` macro.** The brief
said "registration table"; a declarative macro seemed the Rust-native
shape, and it was dropped. A macro hides its expansions from grep and
rust-analyzer, and the fan-out sites that the compiler must police
(`kind()`, `is_sane`, the height walks, the region builders, the
generator dispatch, the DTO mirrors) are exhaustive matches TODAY -
the match arm IS the registration forcing a new kind to be handled.
The table's job is only the parts that were data with no type-checker
behind them: the stamp tag literals, the UI's label/caption/icon/order
columns, the retype seed bodies, the verify mode. Considered and
dropped: inventory-driven Vec registration (runtime allocation for a
compile-time set), and typetag/erase (a dependency for a closed enum).

**The three silent `_ =>` arms were the actual bug class.** panes'
`text_of` answered "3D Finish" for any unknown index, `icon_of`
answered the finish3d glyph, and retype answered a Face - all three
compiled while lying. They now index the table (`ALL.get(i)`), and an
out-of-range index is a `debug_assert` plus a named `eprintln` before
the release-path fallback (Prime Directive: refuse loud, never crash
on a UI path). A new kind that forgets its row cannot compile:
`OpType::ordinal()` is exhaustive, and `info()` debug-asserts
row.ty == self so table order drift dies in the first test run.

**Digest bytes were kept sacred, not just compatible.** `stamp_with`
had `h.write_u8(N)` as the first statement of each arm; the N moved to
the table's `tag` column and the write was hoisted above the match -
the byte stream is identical by construction, which is what let the
793-test lane (and every cached-stamp path) pass untouched instead of
requiring regolden. The registry law (row order == ordinal == tag ==
combo index == ribbon `Create(i)` list) is asserted inside the
existing `stamp_follows_every_input` rather than a new `#[test]`, so
the coverage count stays byte-comparable across the refactor.

**Retype went whole.** The UI's eight `retype` arms and eight
per-kind accessors moved verbatim into app as `retype_params` + the
`Carried` folds - behavior-by-construction, per the M5.0.1 slice
discipline. `Carried::of` preserves both documented quirks (Drill's
climb is always true; Drill's bottom exists only when explicit), and
the two helpers the UI wording tests call (`top_of`/`bottom_of`)
surfaced from private to `operation::` pub - the law comments moved
with them.

**One rung was enough.** The plan's second rung (extracting named
per-kind fns from the generate dispatch) was evaluated and left
undone: those matches are the compile-forced glue the design above
protects, and renaming their bodies into functions would move code
without moving coupling. It gets revisited only when M5.1's ~8 new
kinds make a dispatch arm genuinely heavy - the table means that's a
row + an fn + arms in four honest files, not the 14-file hunt.

## M5.1 stage A — the tool axis rides the move (commit 7313f96)

**The pose lives on the Move, not beside it.** Considered: a parallel
`Vec<Option<axis>>` per path, and a `Toolpath.poses` side-table - both
dropped. A move and its orientation are one fact about one segment;
side tables drift out of step the first time a generator splits or
drops a move. `Move.axis: Option<[f64; 3]>` - unit, tip→shank - makes
the pose travel with the geometry through every existing splice, and
`None` keeps prismatic paths byte-cheap and byte-identical. The exact
vertical `[0, 0, 1]` is filtered `is_vertical`-EXACT, not epsilon: the
branch exists to keep the 3-axis contract bit-for-bit (13 .nc goldens,
untouched), and a near-vertical lean on a filtered-exact branch would
be a silent pose loss. Near-vertical leans that come back from
angles-above are genuinely near-vertical and take the tilt path.

**Angles-above is the one conversion.** axis = Rz(C)·Ry(B)·Rx(A)·ẑ is
the convention the .mch kinematics already state; its canonical
inverse A = asin(clamp(-ay)), B = atan2(ax, az), C = 0 was picked over
full ZYX Euler because C never appears in the dump (the table is
tilted about X and Y; the tool's own spin is the spindle, not an
axis), and one canonical answer keeps generator-written `Move.axis`,
hand-written keyed streams, and the sim's letters all naming THE SAME
angles for the same lean - which `a_dumped_lean_posts_the_same_program_as_a_tilted_stream`
locks end to end.

**Refusal at generation, never mid-stream.** The machine's `can_tilt`
(direction z² < 0.99·|d|² is LEANING, so a trunnion A-about-X passes
and a rotary-B-about-Z on a lathe does not) judges each commanded pose
in `check_document`, and the checks say the move index, the letter,
the degrees, and the travel in the message. Considered and dropped:
silent clamp to travel, nearest-reachable IK, and drop-the-axis - all
three are the silent wrong answer the Prime Directive forbids; a CAM
program either states what it commands or refuses loudly. The safe
floor is deliberate: stage A knows no orientation SEARCH (that's
stage F's collision-aware tilt); here the human commands a pose and
the machine says yes or no.

**The collision bands enclose, never hide.** A leaned cylinder's
swept volume is awkward to test against boxes, so each band becomes
the vertical column that CONTAINS it: center shifted to the band's
mid-height point (`mid·a[x,y]`), radius widened by the band's
half-length spread, z planes grown by the band radius - over-approximate
by construction. Considered: a true OBB swept test (dropped: more math
than a CAM refusal needs, and an approximation that can only ADD a
false graze can never hide a crash - the check's whole job is blocking
the post). The upright path computes the original expressions bit-for-bit,
which is why `stock_sim`'s prismatic goldens stand untouched. Rapids are
deliberately still upright-checked: a leaned RAPID's collision law
belongs to stage B, where indexed 3+2 position moves make the question
concrete.

**The project file stores the pose snapped once at the write.**
`MoveDto.axis` is `#[serde(default, skip_serializing_if)]` - v22 stays
v22, old files load, and a prismatic cache writes no pose key at all.
Snapping to the position lattice at write and attaching VERBATIM at
read (no re-snap) makes save-load-save byte-identical even across
platforms whose libm bits differ; re-snapping on read would let the
same file mean two poses depending on who read it. The cl crate's
section split (moves/path/pose/cycle/tests) rode the same commit
because `pose.rs` is the axis law's new home - 400-line law, and
`axis_to_angles` did not belong bolted to the end of a 700-line file.

## M5.1 stage B - 3+2 tilted-plane indexing (this commit)

**The frame lives in `cl`, not `app`.** `TiltedFrame` (origin, u, v,
axis) is pure pose mathematics next to `angles_to_axis` and
`axis_to_angles`, which it uses and reuses; `app` only owns the
component and the command door. Considered: `geometry` (dropped - the
crate must not know a tool axis exists) and `app/operation` (dropped -
`sim`'s laws and `post` both need the door, and layering forbids them
reading `app`).

**Tilt is a params field, not an Operation component.** Every planar
kind carries `tilt: Option<Tilt>` inside its own params, so the height
expressions, the staleness stamp and the project DTO all ride the
machinery EditOperationParams already has - no new component, no new
command, undo/redo and the file format stay single-track. Considered:
a sibling component on the operation (dropped: it would fork
staleness, retype and the DTO for a field that means nothing to a
3D kind, and `params.tilt()` was already the single accessor the
wrap consults).

**The angles are canonical at the command door.** `Tilt::new` stores
`a`/`b` only after `frame()` succeeds: a non-finite letter or a
zero-norm axis is refused at `CreateOperation`/`EditOperationParams`
by name, so no world state can hold a tilt that cannot command a
direction, and every deep consumer (generate, preview, post, DTO)
sees only a frameable tilt. Considered: refusing at generate time
(dropped: violates "validate early" and would let a bad tilt live in
a saved file).

**Heights are axis distance from the anchor (`h - origin.z`).** The
identity-exact law: `None` tilt and a frame at the origin shift
nothing, so every prismatic file and the 13 .nc goldens ride
untouched - and the number the operator reads is still "how far up
along the tool, from where the part is parked". The honest
asymmetry, found by the parked post fixture: the frame maps the
MATERIAL by `(q - o).axis` (full anchor dot), while L1 shifts heights
by `origin.z` only; for a leaning axis with a perpendicular anchor
offset the two differ. A tilted op's cutting plane is therefore
`h + o.axis - o.z` away from the world origin along the axis, not
`h`. Chosen anyway: any law that made the material and the heights
agree bit-wise forced a rotation of the HEIGHT definition for the
upright case (dropped), and the operator-facing convention - the
plane sits `h` above the anchor, along the tool - is L1's, not the
dot's. A rigid parked twin must shift every height by the dot law
(see `pocket_parked`'s comment). This is the entry to re-open if
stage C's tool-length compensation makes the offset matter in
practice.

**Verification splits: plane laws local, steel laws world.** The
planar laws (gouge, reach, level, rest) are rigid-invariant, so they
walk the LOCAL path against the LOCAL region - the same argument
that makes the whole wrap sound, run on the side of the door where
the numbers are prismatic. The hardware laws (fixture bands, rapids)
walk the WORLD path with stage A's stamped axes, because the machine
steel does not move with the index. One path is posted, both are
measured. Considered: running every law in world coordinates with
tilted band geometry (dropped: re-implements the enclosure
approximations stage A added, for zero extra truth - containment and
distance are the same question in any rigid frame).

**The tilted stock cap takes the frame-image of the world box
corners.** `stock_top_z` in a plane is not the model top minus
origin.z when the slab is tilted; the max over the eight corners of
the stock/model AABB through `z_local` is never below the slab over
any sampled column - over-report a graze, never hide a crash, the
bands law's exact precedent.

**A tilt refuses a picked selection, by name, everywhere.** A Feature
pick is world geometry; projecting a pick onto a tilted plane is not
implemented, and cutting a shadow of it is the silent wrong answer.
`generate` refuses (command error), `region_of` draws nothing (a
preview must not disagree with a refusal), `chains_of` yields
nothing. The law lives in one line each at the three doors, tested
from all three sides.

**The post fixture rides the cached WORLD path.** `check_document`'s
rotary/stroke laws read poses off the stored path's stamped axes
(M5.1 A's law), so a tilted program is machine-checkable without
re-deriving the frame in `machine.rs`; the tilt-only refusal for a
machine with no rotaries is the same read, no new plumbing.
`posting`'s stream carries the WARN records as always - the gate is
unchanged, which is the point: the tilted path passed the same
verdicts or the post blocked.

**Stage-B scope: the five plane kinds.** Face/Contour/Pocket/Slot/
Trace carry the `tilt` field; Drill, Pocket3D and Finish3D have none
to set - their geometry is the hole list and the world-space mesh,
and tilting those is stage C's tool-length story, not this stage's
plane indexing. The params `sane` door answers for all eight arms
one match: whatever `tilt()` returns must be frameable, so a future
kind that grows the field inherits the refusal.

## Phase 6 / M6.1 - adopting the sibling repo's theme architecture (roadmap commit 44a6006; the item merge and this ledger entry land together)

**Chosen:** one Phase 6 theme milestone, M6.1 "Adopt the sibling repo's
theme architecture" - it absorbs the two items that preceded it (the
dark/light spike and the user-theme loader) because the token-table
port delivers both their features as a side effect. Port solidcraft's
`crates/ui-egui` theme design into our egui shell: one named `Tokens` table as the single color+shape truth
(radii, spacing, fonts, control sizes as tokens), Visuals *and* painted
chrome reading the same table with a destructuring arm that turns an
unwired token into a compile error, a versioned JSON theme format
(`camcraft-theme/1` in ours, adapting their `solidcraft-theme/1` shape:
`{format, name, base, colors, radii?}`), compiled-in defaults with a
disk overlay, runtime switcher through the command law, and a
color-vision layer on top. Six work items specced in ROADMAP.md.

**Why:** our `crates/ui/src/egui_app/theme.rs` is a 122-LOC hardcoded
dark `Palette` - 14 colors, no size tokens, nothing loadable. The
sibling repo proves the token-table design on the same stack (egui
0.36 + egui-wgpu), and doing it *before* the rest of the Phase 6 UI
work means every new panel paints from tokens on day one instead of
hand-picking colors twice.

**Considered and dropped:** (a) leaving theming as-is and doing colors
per-panel - rejected, that's the drift the token table exists to kill;
(b) adopting solidcraft's files verbatim - rejected, clean-room law
covers *HSMWorks* material, but a sibling repo's code is still a
third-party dependency for us: we port the architecture, write our own
files, keep the provenance comment honest; (c) deferring to a post-6
polish phase - rejected, every later UI item would otherwise need a
theme retrofit pass.

**Also in this commit:** the Milestone Summary's stale `M6.1 GPU
acceleration` row was replaced by the three Phase 6 UI rows - the GPU
text predates the Phase 6 pivot and was already superseded.

## M5.1 stage C - 5-axis contour & parallel (this commit)

**The pose rides the path; no new geometry kernel.** Chosen: contour5d
and parallel5d are the stage-B waterline ring ladder and the
finishing3d raster line *as emitted*, plus a stamp pass that writes a
tool-axis vector onto every move that ends in contact. Why: a sphere
is rotation-invariant - the ball-center locus a 5-axis finish must
walk is exactly the ball-center locus a 3-axis finish walks - so
building a second generator would fork the scallop stepdown law, the
forbidden-center solver and the floor rule for no cut benefit. The
5-axis content is orientation, and orientation lives in the pose
field stage A added to `Move`. Considered and dropped: a native
5-axis contact solver (point/edge/face contact on a
steep-flank-derived pattern) - rejected for this stage because
without shank-collision-aware pattern planning (stage E's brief) it
buys nothing the stamp doesn't, at the cost of a second geometry
stack.

**The lead/lag axes are the industry pairing, not the plan doc's.**
The stage-C brief in docs/M5-PHASE5-PLAN.md paired lead with the
tangent rotation and lag (side tilt) with the binormal; the
implementation is the opposite: lead leans FORWARD about the binormal
`n x t` (the rotation that tips the tool ahead of the cut), lag leans
SIDEWAYS about the tangent `t`. That is the pairing every public
multi-axis manual and the ISO 10791-10 test-part tradition uses, and
parameter labels are what a machinist reads, so they ride their
standard meaning - the plan doc's swap is a typo in the doc, not a
different law. tilt.rs's module comment says the same.

**Two kinds, not one kind with a pattern field.** Contour5D and
Parallel5D are separate OpType/OpParams arms with near-identical
fields, matching how 2D Finish/3D Finish already split patterns into
kinds; a shared "5-Axis Finish + enum pattern" kind would have made
the registry, the icons and the pages switch on a sub-field, which is
the shape stage B's tilted-plane kinds deliberately avoided. The
catalog row is one bullet (this one) because the ROADMAP wrote it as
one feature.

**The stamp's laws, recorded with the numbers.** Contact is the
tangent equation `|c - q| = r` checked with a band of `0.01 + 1e-6 * r`
- lattice dust and arc-fit slack, never a fraction of the radius a
bite could hide in. Rapids carry no pose (the A/B heads should not
swing during a G0 - and stage A's post writes rapids with no axis word
anyway); a cut move whose END sits in air holds None, so an uncut hop
never pretends to be oriented. Drill cycles cannot be re-posed by a
stamp at all: a tilted spindle with a straight bit would drive the cut
off its own axis, so `stamp_axes` refuses by name (GenError::Invalid)
rather than silently dropping the cycle. A control that states no
direction (a NaN that slipped past the sane door) falls back to
vertical WITH an eprintln - log, never silence.

**max_tilt is a cone fold, never a hard stop.** An over-lean folds
the axis back onto the cone `angle(n, a) = max_tilt` in the plane the
rotation produced - the direction that was reachable stays reachable,
only the excess angle is cut. Refusing the move instead would drop
metal; clamping the angle but keeping the original tilt plane would
snap the lean sideways into the wall. A None clamp runs unclamped;
`<= 0` and `> 180` are refused at command-creation by the sane door as
machine-reach typos, and lead/lag must satisfy `|v| <= 90` - a
91-degree lead is a flipped tool, which is a different machine.

**The axis trio always rides the project file.** v24 writes
lead_deg/lag_deg/max_tilt_deg for every contour5d/parallel5d op even
at defaults, where sibling scallop fields elide at default. Why: a
re-post must never silently change a program - an elided trio in a
file written by a lean-aware build would load 0/0/90 and post a
VERTICAL toolpath under a tilted op's name. The version bump is the
pure step-up rung (v23 -> v24 adds both kinds' tags, 8 and 9, and
nothing else); the tags carry no pattern byte because the pattern IS
the tag.

**Raster end-to-end rides the hill; the dome's raster stays in the
ignored lane.** The new app test `parallel5d_generates_leaning_axes_
and_verifies_clean` tessellates a 6x24 sphere-cap hill, not the 40x80
dome: support_at marches each raster line against the facet soup, so
a full-dome raster on the app's stock/verify stack is minutes in
debug - the law M4.4 parked in the `#[ignore]`d verdict lane
(motion's own `multidirection_rasters_cross` carries the same note).
The command-chain coverage (params -> sane -> generate -> stamp ->
verify -> status) is identical on a coarse tessellation, and
contour5d stays on the big dome (12.7 s, the same cost class as
finish3d_waterline) because the waterline scan is linear-in-levels,
not march-bound.

**The glyphs are drawn original.** assets/ui/contour5d.png (a tilted
spindle over a contour ladder) and parallel5d.png (a tilted spindle
over a raster fan) join the bespoke set - Tabler has no 5-axis mark,
and the pair follows the drill/post/sim/finish3d/fixture precedent
recorded in LICENSES.md, whose note also finally names fixture.png
(an old omission the stage-C sweep caught).

## M5.1 stage D - swarf & advanced swarf (this commit)

**Swarf is the directional raster, not a new geometry kernel.** The
kind reuses finishing3d's raster line verbatim with one addition -
the pass direction `(ux, uy)` read off the mesh - so with a vertical
axis its ball-center positions are BIT-IDENTICAL to stage C's
parallel5d over the same mesh and parameters. Why: the scallop
stepover law, the seam clamp and the ramp/bridge choreography are
one body of tested arithmetic; a second swarf-specific line emitter
would fork all of it for a direction vector. Considered and dropped:
HSMWorks-style "swarf with automatic axis" as a Finish3D pattern flag
- rejected for the same two-kinds-not-one reason as stage C's pair:
the registry, the icons and the pages would switch on a sub-field.

**The ruling law: the mesh tells the pass which way to run.**
`multiaxis::ruling::analyze` fits each facet's surface operator
along its two candidate directions and claims a ruling where one
curvature is development-plain (below the threshold) and the other
is not; a coherent pass direction for the whole set comes from a
signed vote. On a ruled contact the posed axis lies ALONG THE RULING
- lead, lag and the max-tilt cone are IGNORED there (the bullet every
machinist will check: leaning off the blade would make the cylinder
facet cut a groove the profile doesn't have; the lead does no work
on a ruled surface because the cutting velocity is already along it).
Where the analysis withholds its claim - rims, doubly-curved zones,
meshes too coarse for the fit - the contact falls back to stage C's
lean law, so the kind never refuses, it just answers with the
weaker - and honest - orientation.

**Advanced swarf is a tolerance ladder, not a rest-material
strategy.** Pass i from the top cuts at `tolerance·4^i` with
stepover `·2^i` - both because the scallop law is
`stepover ~ sqrt(8r·tol)`: quadrupling tolerance doubles the
scallop-height budget AND the spacing, so each coarse rung removes
its own stock in wide, shallow passes and the final rung is exactly
the plain swarf path. The centers stay tangent to the MODEL every
pass (no z-offset), so the ladder is pure pass-count choreography -
no rest-mesh machinery. Considered and dropped: true rest-machining
(recur over the previous pass's stock) - stage-6-era cost, and the
scallop law already bounds the leftover cusp to the pass's own
tolerance. `passes` is a u32 field gated 1..=4 by the sane door
(more than four rungs puts the coarse pass's stepover past the
part's own width on any realistic tolerance), and the motion-layer
`swarf5d_advanced` carries the same door by name for CLI callers.

**The refusal taxonomy, stated at the seam that knows.** A dome
("no ruling found... this surface wants Finish3D or a 5-axis
contour"), a Z-wall ruling ("the ruling runs along Z; try Contour
or a 3-axis kind"), a mesh whose fit answers everywhere-degenerate
("too coarse for a ruling; Parallel will raster it"), an empty
selection - each refused by name at the first law that can see it,
never a silent fallback to a vertical raster. The 12-row
`stamp_follows_every_input` registry pin (was 8) now carries both
swarf arms - the swarf kinds' axes are per-move, so the same pin
that caught a dropped lead on contour5d catches one here.

**Closed solids are load-bearing at the app level - learned the
hard way.** The swarf family routes through the footprint law
(`region_for` -> `slice::project` over 16 horizontal slices), and
project refuses an OPEN mesh by name ("the mesh is open at z =
...: dangling chord ends"). The app's blade fixture was a tube with
no ends; it now carries end caps, which makes the whole chain -
footprint, selection, stock verify - behave like a real bladed
part. The caps cost something in the pose test: their junction rows
are rims, and the analysis (correctly) withholds the ruling claim
from the columns beside them, at 16 rings that is a large share of
the tube. So `blade_pose_law` counts blade-lying poses (>= 8, every
pose unit-finite, no rapid poses) instead of asserting the
every-body-move universal - the universal identity lives in
motion's `ruling.rs`, tested at the tessellation where the fit is
confident. A dropped ruled-branch would show as zero counted poses
HERE, which is what the test is for.

**stamp.rs crossed the 400-line seam - split at the test, not the
law.** The stamp's exact-angle identities (the pitched-plane ladder
that proves a 15-degree lead to 1e-9) moved to
`multiaxis/stamp_tests.rs`; the law and its documentation stayed in
`stamp.rs`. The seam is the one AGENTS.md names - a file grows past
400 lines, split along the domain edge; here the edge is "the law"
vs "the identities that pin it".

**The future-version probe must be spelled from the constant.**
`wrong_version_is_refused` hardcoded v25 as "the future"; the
stage-D bump to v25 (the rung adding the swarf tags 10, 11 and the
ladder's `passes`, nothing else) made the test ask for a refusal of
a version that was then CURRENT - red in the way that blames the
compiler. Now the probe is `project::PROJECT_VERSION + 1`: a rung
named by hand cannot survive the day the stamp moves.

**The glyphs are drawn original.** assets/ui/swarf.png (a tilted
barrel-cutter along a ruled band) and advancedswarf.png (the same,
through three widening rungs) join the bespoke set per the
contour5d/parallel5d precedent; LICENSES.md names both.

## M5.1 stage E - rotary contour & parallel (this commit)

**The axis is read by circumcenter concurrency - the one anchor law
that is tessellation-proof.** A revolve facet's circumcenter lies in
its own meridian half-plane, so the facet's NORMAL LINE meets the true
axis exactly, whatever the ring count or segment heights. Considered
and disproven on paper before code: anchoring the normal at the
centroid misses by a sixth of the arc at first order (the fan's
one-diagonal asymmetry), the edge midpoint by a quarter, plane-closest
and welded-vertex-average normals fare no better - all three refuse
well-turned parts at coarse tessellations. The normal stays the raw
per-triangle one (welding would reintroduce the fan asymmetry the
center already fixed). Direction: the axis is the EIGEN-SEPARATED
extremum of the area-weighted Σ a·n nᵗ - but BOTH the min and max
eigenvectors are tried and the better RMS wins, because a steep cone
tips the second moment to the other side of 45 degrees (motion's
`a_steep_cone_still_yields_its_axis` exists for exactly that).
Position: least squares of k̂·o = k̂·p with k̂ = n×û over every facet,
plus one pin row (ûûᵗ) through a representative point so the solution
is the axis LINE, not a plane of solutions.

**A bit-exact upright frame is snapped, not hoped for.** Eigen-solves
return (0, 0, 1±1e-16) for parts that stand on the table, and 1e-16
in the direction breaks the `TiltedFrame::is_upright` identity that
the golden law leans on (upright frames carry arcs verbatim, tilted
frames chord them - a hair-off frame would silently switch modes
per platform). So the fit snaps a candidate to the exact axis when it
lands within the noise floor nz = 32·f64::EPSILON·rho of it; anything
beyond is a real lean and rides the chord path honestly. (The same
lane caught a genuine bug on the way: `sym_eigen`'s rotation angle
was an `arctan`, which cannot see the quadrant - now `atan2`.)

**Coarseness gets its own gate: a polygon pretending to be a wall
refuses.** Circumcenter anchoring sees through flatness masquerading
as roundness only via concurrency, so the fit also sweeps the fitted
facets' bearings about the candidate and refuses when the WIDEST
EMPTY SKIP exceeds sqrt(8·REL_TOL) radians - that angle is exactly
the chord-sagitta budget written differently (a turn with skip g
stands in for a wall whose chords sag rho·g²/8). Facing flats bear
no azimuth and justly take no part - shoulders are sharp where
lathes leave them. 16 rings pass, 8 refuse; the fixture budgets are
in the tests.

**The twins refuse each other's degenerate stances, with one shared
sine.** A standing bar asked for parallel passes answers "passes
along a standing bar are its rings: Rotary Contour", and a laid bar
asked for contour rings answers the mirror sentence pointing at
Rotary Parallel; both read LEAN_MIN = sin 1° off the same constant,
so the pair cannot disagree about where the boundary sits. An
isotropic fit (sphere: normals concurrent at a POINT, every axis
equal) is refused as DOMED ground - stage C's kinds, by name - and a
model no candidate fits gets the taxonomy's generic line. Why
refuse a stance instead of computing through it: at lean → 0 the
station map s(H) = (H - o·ẑ)/(û·ẑ) divides by nothing the parameters
can speak in, and inventing a frame there would be the silent wrong
answer the Prime Directive names.

**The pose is the RADIAL, not the surface normal - and the cone
measures off that seed.** On a turned work the line the tool actually
offers the spindle is the perpendicular from the axis to the tool, so
`radial_pose` replaces stage C's facet normal as `command_axis`'s
seed n; flats (caps, floors) get radial poses too - a wall-straddling
ball cares about the axis, not which way its facet faced. Lead leans
in the (radial, travel) plane, lag rotates about the travel, and the
max-tilt cone folds toward... FROM the radial: off = angle(n, a) -
so at lead = lag = 0 the pose IS the radial exactly, cone or no cone
(an app-level law `radial_pose_law` pins: every cut move's pose meets
the axis line to the tool point). Where a point lies ON the axis no
radial exists; the move holds vertical and the fit says so on stderr
- a turned bar's rings do not go there anyway.

**No new pattern kernel, and no new heights machinery: stages A-D
composed.** Rotary contour IS the waterline rung ladder in the axis
frame with heights mapped to axial stations s(H) = (H - o.z)/(û·ẑ) -
the exact stage-B identity when the part stands on its z, and the
honest station reading when it leans; rotary parallel lays the axis
down (local z = as close to world up as the axis allows, an exact
swap for a flat-lying bar) and runs the swarf raster there, where
the rings degenerate into exactly the generatrices the kind is named
for. The fitted axis is MODEL data, not a parameter: the digest adds
the family's pattern (the twins' tags 12/13, the stepover-or-derived
split the raster kinds ride) but no key names the axis - two runs on
one mesh agree by determinism, and a re-fit after a model edit can
never go stale against a stored axis. Project v26 is the two params
tags and nothing else (a v25 file steps up with no new key).

**The fixture bowtie, caught by the footprint law.** The revolve
helper split its wall patches along a SIDE edge (a1,a2,b2)+(a2,b1,b2)
- on a cylinder the four corners are not coplanar, and that pairing
is a bowtie: two crossed diagonal slits per patch. `fit` never
noticed (normals are per-triangle truth), motion's identity tests
never noticed (both sides of an identity read the same mesh), but
the app's `slice::project` footprint law refuses an OPEN mesh by
name and said so - "the mesh is open at z = -15: 32 dangling chord
ends" - on the first honest run. Both fixtures now split along the
DIAGONAL (a1,b2,b1). The lesson rides stage D's: closed solids are
load-bearing at the app level, and a fixture bug is worth catching
even where only a stricter law can see it.

**The glyphs are drawn original** (assets/ui/rotarycontour.png: the
turned bar with its station rings, the ball riding OUT on the radial;
rotaryparallel.png: the same bar with generatrix lines along it) -
no Tabler mark says 4-axis rotary, and the ball is deliberately off
the surface on the radial line, the kind's whole claim; LICENSES.md
names both.

**Phase 7 - the SDF preview engine: what the research decided.** The
user's directive (replace the voxel preview with an implicit
signed-distance rendering of the machined volume) fixed the goal; the
shape was ours to take, specced from a Perplexity sweep of the public
literature: MERL's composite-ADF milling simulation gave the two
cornerstones - machined volume = Boolean difference of distance fields,
and the inverted-trajectory law (evaluate in the tool frame, so a
5-axis pose is one matrix inverse, not a swept geometry); the 2026
GPU-SDF + Marching-Cubes material-removal twin paper (~105 FPS, ~35x
mesh booleans) proved real-time feasibility on exactly our hardware
class; the distance-accumulating voxel twin supplied the
running-minimum accumulation that makes overlapping cuts
order-independent and seam-free. Choices taken unattended: **(1)** the
field is sparse BRICKS under a flat brick map, not an octree - the
streaming/voxel-hashing line keeps reaching this for updatable fields
(deep trees lose cache coherence; updates want shallow), reconsider if
a part's band ever outgrows the brick map's memory law; **(2)**
direct sphere-traced rendering in the viewport is the primary path and
marching cubes is a DERIVATION for triangle consumers (picking, STL
export) - the mesh-extract-only alternative was dropped because it
re-imposes a resolution choice at every frame, which is the voxel sin
Phase 7 exists to leave behind; **(3)** the pseudo-SDF pessimism of
CSG/sweeps is kept as a FEATURE, in the direction that underestimates
clearance - rest over-reports, gouges never hide, the dexel's own
honest-noise law promoted to a field - with eikonal re-normalization
owed only to the render's shading; **(4)** the sampled-pose
swept-volume fallback is display-only by law - a verdict query needs a
closed form or it refuses; **(5)** the dexel retires only after
M7.3's dual-engine verdict agreement on the heavy lane, so the phase
is additive, reversible, and the existing gouge/rest/deviation goldens
stay the refusable oracle throughout. Considered and dropped: hybrid
dexel+SDF forever (two truths to reconcile in every verdict - the
verification-layer law forbids a second source of truth, and a second
verification layer doubles the agreement surface); sparse voxel
octree as the field store (the middle option the M1.7 question offered
- strictly dominated by brick maps for dynamic narrow-band fields).
Slotting it as Phase 7 after Phase 6 (UI theming) rather than between
5 and 6 is ours: nothing in it blocks Phase 5's kinds, and the
renderer wants Phase 6's engine settled first.

## M5.1 stage E2 - rotary offset roughing (this commit)

**The pocket ladder runs in wrap space, and stepdown is the RADIAL
infeed.** A turned solid has no z-staircase worth roughing - its
levels ARE its stations, already laid along the axis - so the kernel
develops the part one full period into (s, v, rho) (circumference
arc length, axial station, radius) and runs pocket3d's staircase law
there with the infeed along rho. The consequence is a fixture
lesson, recorded rather than padded: the staircase reads each
column's stock off its own part surface, so a part step WIDER than
the infeed can't be shaved by one radial plunge - the turned bar's
6.0→5.0 step leaves that whole annular shelf to the finishing kinds
at infeeds ≥ 1.0, and the tests budget a sub-1.0 infeed to peel it
honestly instead of inventing levels the geometry doesn't have.
Considered and dropped: a z-direction ladder on the wrapped body -
it re-reads the same law but pretends a revolve has floor-to-floor
heights it does not have.

**tolerance is verify budget only; stock_to_leave folds into the
plan.** The kernel never consumes tolerance (`let _ = tolerance;`):
the wrap development is exact, there is no sampler for a tolerance
to bound. It rides outward solely as the Envelope verify's
finish_tol. stock_to_leave gets no separate offset pass either - it
folds into the plan's center offset, so the ladder peels down to
finish-plus-leave exactly once. Both still ride the params tag: a
parameter that moves no point on the path still rides the digest,
so a re-run with changed numbers is never mistaken for an
identical one.

**No retract_z parameter: the kernel names its own rapids plane.**
A round bar has one honest air plane - one infeed clear of the
biggest radius plus two tool radii, rho_max + stepdown + 2r,
computed off the wrap. The twins' user-named z retract belongs to a
prismatic stock whose top is a plane; ported here it would be a
dial with exactly one safe setting, which is a law, not a
parameter. Considered and dropped: retract_z with a default - the
safe default IS the computed plane, so the parameter adds only ways
to set it low and gouge.

**The verify posture is law (f) plus a named gate: Mode::Envelope,
finish_tol = tolerance, ball-nose refused at generate.** The swept
sphere is pose-invariant about its own axis, so stage C's envelope
argument holds verbatim for radial poses - no pose-respecting sweep
tax. An end mill's flat profile is not pose-invariant in the sense
the law needs, so the ball-nose gate refuses by NAME at generate
rather than verifying a path through an envelope it doesn't
enclose.

**The wrap mesh is one period deep, with seam walls at the station
table.** The developed body is the 2·pi·rho_max duplication, seam
walls closing every band at the station table, so islands crossing
the seam are one island, not two, and the ladder never sees a
phantom wall at the period boundary. The facet law is by vertex
count: a facet with exactly TWO off-axis vertices (its apex on the
axis) sweeps the full developed rectangle - its wedge - because its
radius spans 0..rho along the developed arc linearly; everything
else sweeps its station patch. That is what lets cone flanks rough
clean instead of leaving an uncut hub band.

**The caller's top_z/bottom_z window STATIONS when the fitted axis
leans.** pocket3d's z-window reads as world heights; on a leaned
revolve the band between two z-planes is not a band of the part, so
the kernel overrides the semantics: top/bottom bound axial stations
on the fitted axis, and the radial ladder spans rho_max..rho_min
regardless - the window selects LENGTH along the bar, never DEPTH
into it. The parameter mirror says so, so the panel speaks stations
too.

**Additive kind, no renumbering: RotaryOffset at ordinal/tag 14,
PROJECT_VERSION 27.** The variant lands after the twins (12/13);
the project file steps v26→v27 with the one new params tag and no
key renames - a v26 file rides up with nothing new to store. The
fitted axis stays MODEL data, stage E's law unchanged: the digest
names the pattern, not the axis. Ribbon glyph
assets/ui/rotaryoffset.png is drawn original - a stepped shaft with
the ladder wrapping it radially; no generic set says rotary
roughing, and LICENSES.md notes it as original.

## M5.1 stage E3 - multi-axis roughing (this commit)

**The composition law: MultiAxisRough = pocket3d_prev + stamp_axes,
and nothing else.** The kernel builds the prismatic ladder move for
move - same lattice, same mask seam, same Empty remap - and then
runs stage C's stamp over the finished path. That is the whole kind.
It buys the verify posture for free: a sphere's envelope is
rotation-invariant about its own center, so the Envelope scan of the
posed path encloses exactly the volume of the vertical one - stage
C's law (f) restated for the rough. Considered and dropped: a
roughing kernel of its own that searched poses while it cut - it
would move positions, and a ladder whose positions differ from the
3-D pocket's is a different operation, not the pocket with the
spindle posed; the identity IS the safety argument.

**Floors pose nothing: a degenerate contact normal yields pose None,
which posts as honest vertical.** The stamp reads the axis off the
contact normal at a move's end; on a floor the contact is the ball's
bottom pole and its normal is the tool axis itself - the search
returns d = 0, poses None, and the move runs vertical. Wall
tangencies are the only posed moves the ladder ever makes. The probe
agrees: on the slab+boss job all 12 poses of the stamped ladder come
out horizontal where walls ask for them and vertical everywhere else
- the floors are silent, exactly as the law says they must be.

**The ball-nose gate sits at generate, and names kind and tool.**
The stamp's tangency search reads contact off a sphere; a flat
end's flank is a cylinder the law does not own - there is no centre
to place off a wall, so a leaned end mill is a gouge waiting for its
verdict. The refusal is "Multi-Axis Rough needs a ball-nose tool,
'<name>' is a <kind>": same posture as the wrap's gate (E2), refuse
by name rather than verify a path through an envelope the tool
doesn't have.

**rest_rough and feed_opt are deferred, and their absence is stated
rather than faked.** The pocket's bridge carries two switches the
stamped ladder ships without - the kernel reads neither, so the DTO
mints neither. The honest reason: both features are specced against
a vertical-only tool, and the stamp has never been shown to commute
with either (a rest scan under a leaned ladder, a feed modulated by
an engagement the poses redistribute). A switch that changes
nothing under poses is a lie with a UI; absence is truer. Considered
and dropped: wiring the flags to the pocket arm and hoping - hoping
is not a verification.

**The wire is a pure step-up: v27 -> v28, tag `multi_axis_rough`,
"step-up is the stamp itself".** Serde snake_case mints the tag
from the variant name; the version steps with one new params tag and
no key renames, so a v27 file rides up with nothing new to store.
Unlike the wrap ladder, which computes its rapids plane and mints no
hop key, this ladder's retract_z is the pocket's own stated hop and
rides the file via `skip_serializing_if` - absent at the default,
present once named, bit-identical to the Pocket3D bridge's shape.

**The registry law re-confirmed from the inside: KindInfo::ALL grew
15 -> 16 and the UI followed without being told.** ALL_LABELS and
KIND_COUNT feed the pickers dynamically, so the new kind appeared in
every menu for free; only the four files that must spell each kind
by hand grew arms - icons.rs, panes.rs, pages.rs, interact.rs. M5.0
and M5.1 kinds since then keep the claim honest: a new operation is
a params struct, a generator fn, a table row and four hands.

**A law found by this stage's own test: GenerateOperation::new()
generates at construction, so program order is masking order.** The
identity test that wants a stamped ladder and a plain pocket side by
side in one world fails for a reason no one wrote: names sort, a
later-generated op digests the prior program (Pocket3D reads the
re-machining mask from it), and the earlier op's stamp is masked
away - the twins go Stale against each other. The test therefore
runs two lone worlds, mirroring the remachining tests' law that a
mask is a statement about the program, not about the part.

**Discovery on the way: the shipped Pocket3D with a ball tool over a
finished floor verifies CLEAN.** No app test had exercised that pair
before E3's twin needed it as the vertical baseline. The floor law -
d = 0, pose None, vertical - holds empirically, and because the
stamped kind's positions are the pocket's bit for bit, the twin
inherits the verdict rather than earning it separately.

## M5.1 stage F - collision-aware orientation (this commit)

**The dodge is pose-only, and law (f) is the license.** A sphere's
envelope is rotation-invariant about its own center, so at a fixed
CL point the cut is fixed and the axis is free: leaning the spindle
cannot gouge a micron the vertical pose did not already own. Stage F
spends exactly that freedom - it changes NOTHING but the axis
fields. The test proves the claim and not a weaker one: positions
bit-for-bit identical to the flag-off path, surface-stated poses
untouched wherever the shank stays quiet, floors posed ONLY where
the shank speaks. Considered and dropped: re-running the escape
search on the surface-stated poses themselves - F never overrides
the contact law, it only overrules it where the tool above the ball
disagrees with it.

**The collision test is verify's law (c), not a new one.** The
enclosure mirrors `camcraft_sim::verify` band for band: a vertical
band's column floor stands AT the band's lower end, a leaning band's
dips to the lower axis end minus the band radius (only its swept
rim reaches below the axis-plane end), and the annulus inside the
cutting radius is the flute's own kerf, excused - with the strict
`box_top > h0` gate so the floor being cut can never report itself.
The motion side tests the CONTINUOUS facets where verify samples
them, so a graze may be over-reported here and stay clean there:
over-report a graze, never hide a gouge, and verify remains the
post-time law. One builder (`shank_of`) feeds generator and
verifier from the same Tool stack, so they can never disagree about
what the shank is. Considered and dropped: a continuous
swept-volume collision test - cost with no verdict the endpoint
enclosure plus verify doesn't already give, and the house law is
conservative, not exact.

**The tilt amount is geometry's answer; the azimuth is what the
head pays.** Discovered by the law tests and encoded in them: every
row of a flat wall gets the SAME tilt regardless of the previous
pose - the escape candidate net (tilts {0, cap/4, cap/3, cap/2,
2cap/3, 3cap/4, cap, th0} x 8 azimuths 45 deg about the contact
normal, cap = max(cone, nominal lean) clamped to 85) is sorted by
angle from the HELD pose, so shortest axis travel decides which
clear azimuth wins, ties broken by the nominal's own lean. The held
state resets to home after an unposed feed and holds through rapids
- the smoothing is what stops an escape oscillating between
neighboring moves. The refusal contract is the flag: off, the path
generates exactly as in E3 and the verifier warns at post time; on,
generation REFUSES by name ("the shank of the tool touches the part
at move i...", naming the cone's remedies) - the Prime Directive
favors refusing to ship a known rub.

**A tool with no clear angle must refuse, never thrash.** The
narrow-slot fixture states the design law its doc-comment carries:
a stub clears only if its flute is short enough that its rim
reaches the wall's z-span AND a nonzero cone window exists - for
the 6 mm-flute fixture, theta in (9.6, 33.6] degrees. When the
geometry leaves NO clear angle inside the cone, the honest answer
is a refusal naming the shank and the cone, not a spindle flipping
between poses; that fixture pins the escape-vs-refusal boundary.
Considered and dropped: offering the dodge on the rotary kinds -
their radial axis IS the surface's answer, there is no free axis
left to spend.

**The wire is a pure step-up: v28 -> v29, `shank_avoid` inside the
three axis-law DTOs.** `#[serde(default)]` means an absent key is
exactly the v28 pose law (dodge off), so a v28 file rides up with
nothing to translate; the flag is always written on save. It rides
the params digest, so flipping it ages the cached path - staleness
stays derived, never tracked. The UI is one checkbox, "Shank
avoidance (5-axis)", shown in the params panel for the three
axis-law kinds only - the kinds the law actually reaches.

**Gate notes:** 23/23 test binaries green, the 13 goldens
byte-identical (the flag defaults off, so nothing's path changes);
`crates/motion/tests/multiaxis_avoid.rs` carries the five law tests
(never-moves-path, floors-only-where-shank-speaks,
escape-inside-cone-and-calm, slot-refuses-by-name,
quiet-shank-purity), the app seam four, `project_roundtrip` the v29
step-up.

## M5.1 stage G - machine simulation (this commit)

**The head turns on its own clock: every move is a linear leg and a
rotary leg, secs = max(the two), and a family HOLDS at arrival.**
The timeline paces XY at the feed and A/B/C at the rotary rate;
the slower leg keeps running while the faster one freezes at its
spot - XY parked in air while the head swings, the head settling
after the path has arrived. When the two legs take equal seconds
the axis is bit-exact prismatic, so the split costs nothing the
old sim did not already do, and the sim viewer shows the arc the
machine actually takes, not the straightened version of it.

**Rotary rates live under the rotaries' own roof, not in one
shared "angular feed": `Traverse.rot` is per-axis deg/min with
normal/rapid pairs, fed from the .mch mirror** (machine.rs mirrors
them), rapid falling back to normal, feed to normal-or-rapid.
Considered and dropped: a single angular rate - the .mch format
names rates per axis family, so a law invented at one family's
granularity gets refought at every call site, and one rate would
have to guess which letter it speaks for.

**The hold-at-arrival law is behavior-only provenance.** Public
G-code manuals' coordinated-motion blocks: each commanded axis
family travels at its own rate and holds when its part is done,
the program waiting on the rest. Nothing of HSMWorks was read for
this; it is the manuals' law in our own code, per the Clean-Room
Protocol.

**The sim threads the post's modal pose law, it does not re-derive
it.** sim.rs carries each segment's [from,to] letter pair from the
same law the post writes - rapids hold the pose, an unposed cut
returns home. A second copy of that law in the verifier is the
classic way for poster and sim to disagree about where the head
was; one law, threaded.

**Law (c3) tests the arc law (c) can't see: 4 path fractions x 5
pose fractions, pose endpoints in, path endpoints out.** The
to-point at the to-pose is law (c) verbatim, so path endpoints are
excluded; but "at the to-pose, not yet at the to-point" is
reachable - when the head's arc is the short leg it finishes its
swing while XY is still in transit - so the pose endpoints stay
on the grid. And a zero-XY plunge that turns while it descends is
never skipped: its lean column slides through a Z window that is
a superset of both endpoints', so neither endpoint sees what the
middle does.

**One verdict per band: (c3) speaks only where (c) is clean.** The
moves law (c) convicted are skipped via the shanked list rather
than merged into a combined verdict - (c)'s same-band warning
keeps its wording and a band never reports twice.

**The cost is paid with a sample filter, not a narrower gate: (c3)
runs where its twin (c) runs, mode != Engrave.** The obvious gate
- Area | Boundary - would have been inert on every generated
posed program: every posed 5-axis kind verifies as Mode::Envelope
(`crates/app/src/operation/kinds.rs`, rows 728-802), and a law
that never runs is decoration. The 20-state grid therefore costs
against the nearby columns only: the 40 states are collected with
a union-bounding-box filter over the boundary samples. Considered
and dropped: the Area | Boundary gate, inert - see above.

**The wire is a pure step-up: v29 -> v30, `Warning::SweepHit` the
reason.** A v29 file cannot carry the new tag, so the serde
ladder just raises the number and there is nothing to translate;
the lossy-JSON mirror fallback pattern from M3.3 A was considered
and dropped as unnecessary here - it guards a round-trip an
absent tag can never make lossy. The UI keys the tag at 200+part
in fold_warnings, clear of FixtureHit's range, and the status
line reaches it through the last_move or-pattern.

**Gate notes:** 51/51 app integration, 131/131 UI, 68/68 unit,
clippy -D warnings clean on all four crates; the 13 .nc goldens
byte-identical (stage G warns, it never edits a path);
`crates/sim/src/sim.rs` carries the 22 leg-split unit tests and
the app seam (`crates/app/tests/sim.rs`,
a_posed_move_paces_on_its_rotary_slot_through_app_sim) proves the
family clock through app::sim.

## M5.1 stage H - entry family and real engagement stepping on the planar pocket (code 1544b16 + this docs)

**One engagement law, one home: the dive/helix/engagement family
lifted into `crates/motion/src/entry.rs`, where both ladders call
it.** The laws specced at M2.1 for the 3-D ladder read only planar
geometry and the move chain, which the 2-D ladder shares, so
`machining2d` reaches `dive_point`, `helix_down`, `engagement_step`
and `chord_hits_plan` there instead of machining3d re-exporting
them for a second copy to shadow; the legality arguments that are
ladder-specific (the islands superset) stay with each ladder.
Considered: separate 2-D copies of each law (dropped: the laws are
identical, and two copies of an engagement law drift - drift is a
gouge risk).

**`run_levels` stays infallible: an entry-shaping failure degrades
to the plain vertical plunge at that level.** A failed offset or a
dive scan that finds no legal midpoint gives that level the motion
the pre-H ladder always took; the rest of the path is unaffected
and still honest. Considered: Result plumbing through the ladder
(dropped for now - the geometry itself is fine, an honest coarse
path beats a refused job, and the verify laws still catch real
collisions).

**Adaptive stops being a relabeled Zigzag: rings step by `tool_r x
(1 - cos(max_engagement))` - the 3-D side's constant-engagement
law, now on the plane - and the reach door asks the EFFECTIVE
step.** Raw stepover stays bounded even at tight engagement angles
because the door measures what the rings actually do, not what the
field says. Zigzag, Waterline and Auto emit their pre-H bytes
untouched: the 13 `.nc` goldens are byte-identical.

**The wire is three additive `#[serde(default)]` fields on the
existing Pocket DTO arm; PROJECT_VERSION stays at v30.** A file
without `entry` reads Plunge, the seed's 1.0 mm helix radius and
the law's 45 degrees - the pre-H behavior - and re-saves complete;
an unknown entry tag refuses as Corrupt rather than guessing.
Considered: a version bump plus migration (dropped: additive
defaults are a lossless step-up, the same precedent as `rest_rough`
and `feed_opt`).

**The stamp digest gains the two floats, then the strategy byte,
then the entry byte.** Fixed order so every path to the hash agrees;
pre-H operations come up Stale exactly ONCE and regenerate
byte-identically - the staleness is one-time and provably cosmetic.

**The tilted-helix test law: a tilted pocket's cached path is
already world-expressed, so axial depth is a plain dot with the
axis letter.** The tilt door ran at generate; mapping the stored
path through the frame again invented a phantom slope of stepover x
sin(belt) - the new tilt test caught it in development, and the law
is pinned there so the next reader dots instead of transforms.

**Toolchain lint drift rode this commit: rust 1.99's `manual_find`
and `collapsible_if`/let-chain lints newly fired on committed stage
F/G code.** sim's `sweep.rs` and motion's `avoid.rs` take the fixes
here because a red clippy lane blocks every gate; the walk guard
keeps NaN semantics through the NaN-honest form (`total <= 0.0 ||
!total.is_finite()`), so the lint fix changed no verdict.

**Gate note, recorded so nobody hunts it: a gate lane reported a
compile error citing a `cutter_axis` field on `MultiAxisContour` -
verified false.** No such identifier exists anywhere in the tree;
a transient mid-edit state, not chased.

## M5.1 stage I - 5-axis flowline finishing (code 378184a + this docs)

**Two kinds, not one table: Flow5D takes its own `OpType` arm and
its own params struct rather than a mode flag on
`Contour5D`/`Parallel5D`.** Its source is the whole model surface -
the direction field is a reading of the mesh, not a pattern choice
- and its geometry is a curved-line family with its own seeding
law. A mode flag would have forked both twins' signatures: every
or-pattern the twins already share (`kinds.rs` carry, `sane.rs`
door, `params.rs` digest) becomes a two-shape read and the
parallel's pattern field starts lying about which lines it picked.
Considered: `pattern: Flow` on Parallel5D (dropped: the raster
twins' DTO and digest author LINE CHOICE as a parameter; making it
a reading restamps what every v30 parallel file says about itself).

**The SEED/CLAIM cusp law: half-step seeds, half-step claims.**
Seeds walk the shallow footprint's bounding box on a lattice
`SEED_FRAC` = 0.5 of the stepover apart (`crates/motion/src/
finishing3d/flow.rs`), and a seed whose column lies within
`CLAIM_FRAC` = 0.25 stepover of an already-traced segment (or a
spent seed point) is spent WITHOUT tracing - the traced set is
maximal under the claim radius. (`CLAIM_FRAC` shipped at 0.5 with
stage I's code; commit d597201 halved it to 0.25 so the kernel
doc's law `CLAIM_FRAC + SEED_FRAC/2 <= 0.5` holds as an identity -
at 0.5 a diverging field left ground 0.56 of a step from every
traced line, past the half-step promise, and straight ground,
whose rows answer to `SEED_FRAC`, was never the law's worry.) A
ground point is never farther
from a line than its nearest seed plus the seed's claim, so
turning ground keeps the CLAIM + half-seed bound (the swirl test
pins 1.1 stepovers, where the circles' radial spacing quantizes);
straight ground, where the half-step rows are ALL traced, keeps
the straight raster's own promise exactly - every interior point
within half a stepover (plus the march's lattice quantum) of a
chord, scallop a QUARTER of tolerance. The spacing promise is the
seeding's; the envelope verdict, never the spacing, is what says
nothing gouges. Considered: seeding one line per full stepover and
claiming at half (dropped: a turning family converges as well as
diverges, and the half-step lattice is what keeps the promise
inside the grid's quantization).

**The direction field has a global fallback, so unclaimed columns
still cut.** Flat interiors make no directional claim and the
waterline rings do not machine them - a flow pass that stalled
there would be silently unfinished, the Prime Directive's own
worst shape. So the field answers an unclaimed column with the
region's dominant direction: the double-angle (2theta) vote
weighted by facet area, theta and theta+PI casting ONE vote for
the line they share, and +x when nothing claims at all. On plain
ground the whole path IS the parallel raster's answer, said in the
geometry and not in a warning - flow never fails to cut.

**`curv.rs`: one curvature kernel, two readers.** The shape-
operator fit lifted out of `ruling.rs` (stage D's machinery), so
the ruling scan (swarf) and the direction field (flow) solve the
SAME least-squares normal-difference systems per facet - the field
the two kinds see cannot drift apart, and a fit corrected fixes
both. `min_dir_xy` states the flow reader's refusals: a starved
neighbourhood (< 6 answerable facets), an isotropic facet (a
sphere's eigenpair is numerical noise, and noise must never steer
a spindle) and a claim lying along Z all answer None - no claim,
never a guessed claim.

**v31 is a PURE step-up.** Flow5D rides the existing component DTO
grammar as one new tag, `flow5d` (the serde rename states it -
the automatic snake_case of `Flow5D` would be `flow5_d`), and the
migration arm only raises the number: a v30 file cannot carry the
tag and every key v31 adds has a default that IS the old
document's behavior. The stepover-None derivation law is the
raster twins' cos law restated -
`p.stepover.unwrap_or(scallop_stepover(r, tol) * mz_min)` - and
absent `retract_z` means the kernel's own rapids plane.
`shank_avoid` is surface truth, not a free axis: absent reads as
off, but the flag is always WRITTEN - the digest and none-key
handling joined the raster twins' or-patterns so hash, file and
world agree. The loader's sane door (a 200-degree cone refuses as
Corrupt) is the twins' door read by the third sibling.

**The field's lookup: nearest facet centre over 3x3 buckets with a
two-cell reach cutoff.** Buckets are one cell per two mean facet
edges, so a 3x3 query sees the centre whose Voronoi cell the
column stands in on any near-uniform mesh; past two cells' reach
the column is over ground no facet answers for, and the fallback's
straight lines are the honest answer there. Considered:
point-in-triangle lookup (dropped: a centre's claim standing over
its cell is the same quantization the ruling scan already trusts,
and the nearest-centroid walk never races a Delaunay structure).

**The glyph is original: no Tabler flowline icon exists**, so
`assets/ui/flow5d.png` is drawn here - the dome cross-section with
the leaning ball-end, the parallel's chord bent into the blade's
own sweep ("ours to give", the house glyph law).

**GATE NOTE, recorded so nobody hunts it: the rotary-mirror law
test in `crates/app/tests/machine.rs` had rotted at HEAD since
stage G** - G moved the rotary rates under the rotaries' own roof
(`Traverse.rot`, fed from the .mch mirror), but G's gate never ran
the app machine binary lane, so the old "geometry, never speeds"
assert survived asserting a law the code no longer spoke. Stage
I's gate ran the lane and caught it; the test now states the
stage-G law truthfully: speeds ride under the rotary's own roof
for the paced head swing, and the prohibition is only deg/min
LEAKING INTO the prismatic `rapidRate` (the ceiling pin stays).
Renamed `rotaries_mirror_as_geometry_and_rates_never_as_the_ceiling`.

**GATE NOTE 2: clippy on rust 1.99 flagged `doc_lazy_continuation`
on `//! - text` dash clauses and `unnecessary_map_or` in stage I's
new code.** Fixed in-flight (`is_none_or` is the spelling; the
module docs were reflowed); the law for future module docs is an
opening parenthetical, not a dash list.

## M5.1 stage J - multi-axis contour on drive curves (code caaab7a + this docs)

**The picks ARE the source: chain picks ride the existing
`SrcRef::Selection(Chain)` field, not a params field.** The path
this kind machines is the user's selection, so it is stored where
every other selection lives, and the digest staleness machinery
follows for free - the stamp's `b'L'` arm (`stamp.rs`) already
re-stamps on model edits, so moving the model re-flags the
operation without any new plumbing. Considered: chains in params
(dropped: it duplicates the selection plumbing and breaks the
Geometry section's single source of truth - two fields would then
claim to say what the machine goes to, and only one would be
stamped).

**The region is the model's silhouette, not the picked loops** -
`region_for` answers with `slice::project` over the whole model
through the exclusion-list arm in `region_for_src`. The chains
ride the surface, so depth and preview must show what the whole
model cuts, not a hairline trace of the picks; and the 2D walk's
"is an open run" refusal never applies to this kind - the picks
were never asked to enclose anything, they asked to be walked.
Considered: region = picked loops (dropped: a preview of the
curves alone hides the model standing under the ball, and the
open-run law would refuse the kind's own honest input).

**The window law refuses BY VERTEX, never clips.** Every chain
vertex must stand within [bottom_z, top_z] or generation refuses
("picked chain N stands at z ..., outside the window"); it never
clips a chain to the window and never silently trims. Refuse-
loudly is the Prime Directive's shape: a clipped chain posts a
program that abandons the user's pick somewhere invisible, which
is exactly the silent wrong answer the law forbids. Considered:
clip-to-window (dropped: same reason, in the worst possible
dress).

**`tolerance` is the verify budget only** - the kernel's
deviation check, the envelope scan's chord allowance. It is NOT
a resample step: resampling the chain into stations is the
kernel's own arc-length law, and borrowing tolerance for it
would make a verify knob silently change where the tool goes.

**v32 is a PURE step-up.** One new tag, `multi_axis_contour`,
auto-derived by serde - unlike `Flow5D` (whose snake_case needed
the explicit `flow5d` rename to dodge `flow5_d`) the variant
name already snake-cases cleanly, so no rename was needed.
`retract_z` is an `Option`, skip-serialized when absent (the
kernel's own rapids plane answers); `shank_avoid` carries
`#[serde(default)]` and is always WRITTEN, surface truth as in
stages F/I. No migration code: a v31 file cannot carry the tag,
PROJECT_VERSION 32.

**Kernel station law** (`crates/motion/src/multiaxis/curve.rs`):
each chain vertex is a station read through the FAN of model
planes meeting there - smooth fans merge to one plane, an edge
is two planes, a corner is three. The ball rests on the
bisector at h = r/max|cos|, and the pass side (which way is
down) resolves by winding - edge-pairing closure plus signed
volume - with air/sink bids as the fallback vote; a floating
chain, one whose points find no model under them, refuses "off
the model". CLAIM: the pose law is stage C's lead/lag tilt then
max-tilt rejection, shared with flow5d's AxisControl - the same
trio, read station by station off the fan rather than off a
raster's surface normal.

**The glyph is original:** `assets/ui/multiaxiscontour.png` -
the dome with the picked chain's dots on it and a leaning
ball-end tool, drawn from scratch; no vendor material, no
HSMWorks reference (clean-room protocol, assets clause).

**UI: the two height planes ARE the machining window.** They
draw the same ladder pair as flow's, but documented as "what
may be cut" rather than cut depths - for this kind an outside
vertex is refused, not clamped, so the pair states the
refusal's bounds.

## M5.1 close-out - the dome flow verdict and the yardstick's chord (code `fix(sim): measure arcs with the generator's own chord law - the dome flow verdict goes clean (M5.1 close)` + this docs)

**The law caught a gouge that the path never cut.** `dome_flow_is_envelope_clean` (motion's verdict lane) read 0.088 mm on the 12x96 dome against a gate of 0.0734, and it rode every flow5d path the app's verify would one day block. The fix decision was made against measurements, not theories, so they are on the record: a faithful sweep of the whole path - 49 samples a move, arcs walked as true circles, exact point-to-triangle distance - never penetrated the mesh past 0.0121 mm, inside the march's own chord promise (tol/4 = 0.0125); and at the blamed rim-band column the ring tail's emitted G2 arc is TANGENTIAL, sinking 0.003 mm of clearance, not material. The rows keep the law. The rings keep the law. The number that failed was the yardstick's own discretization.

**What the scan was doing.** `envelope_scan` cut every arc to chords with a sagitta budget of `cell/4` - 0.094 mm on the r/8 lattice the ball-radius grid builds - which is larger than the `tol + floor` gate (0.0734) the same function feeds. A chord inside a circle cuts the corner; at the tangential ring, where the ball grazes the tilted flank (contact tilt ~43 deg), that corner-cut moves the ball's center 0.09 mm into the forbidden region and the sphere bottom lands 0.075 mm BELOW the facet plane - a trench no machine arc ever drags. The dome flow is all-shallow, so the ring tail repeats the waterline's ladder over ground the rows already own, and its deepest ring sits exactly on the tilt band where the phantom is worst - which is why the waterline verdict rode just under the gate with the same arcs and only flow tripped it.

**Chosen: the measurement keeps the generator's own chord law.** `chord_tol = tol * 0.25` - "every XY shortcut keeps tolerance/4", the same sentence the march and ring law docs already promise - one budget, shared by `subtract_ball` (the Dexel truth) and `center_segments` (the distance truth), so the two truths read one polyline as the law demands. Direction matters: this TIGHTENS the instrument 7.5x (0.094 -> 0.0125). A machine follows the commanded arc, chord or not, so no real gouge hides better than before; only phantoms shrink. The gate formula, every threshold, and every generator are untouched - the 13 .nc goldens and all waterline dumps are byte-free, and MAX_ARC_CHORDS (1024) never binds at this budget on the fixture radii.

**Considered and dropped.** (a) A ring JURISDICTION filter - seed `rings_and_tail` only from steep facets when the raster already owns shallow ground, matching rings.rs's own doc ("the steep flanks ride the waterline rings"): the measurements killed it - the phantom is tangency, not jurisdiction, so a steep-enough dome with one shallow shelf keeps the same false trench, and waterline-only paths carry it unfiltered. It would have fixed one fixture's symptom while leaving the yardstick wrong. (b) Emitting rings as polylines instead of G2 arcs: churns every waterline golden to repair the verifier by disarming the generator, and a polygon chord budget (~tol) is no better than the arcs' own sagitta law - the smooth arc IS the feature. (c) Raising the floor or the gate: forbidden by law, and unnecessary - the truth needs no allowance.

**Ripples, checked.** Production verify's envelope law (f) shares `envelope_scan`, so phantom refusals on tangential rings disappear machine-wide - never a real refusal with them, by the direction argument. The live display sim (`cut.rs::simulate`) keeps its cell-budget chords - a picture on the viewer's lattice, not a verdict - now said in its comment instead of citing a law it no longer mirrors. Rest is untouched where straight lines own it: the dome flow reports 0.04851 mm before and after, below the gate; the finer chords only move ring-graze columns toward their honest (lower) distance.

**The verdict, measured.** Dome flow gouge 0.08238 -> 0.01656 mm (gate 0.07344), rest unchanged; `dome_flow_is_envelope_clean`, `dome_waterline_is_envelope_clean` and the whole finish3d verdict lane (27/27) green in release; sim and app lanes run by the gate; tag m5.1-done closes the milestone.

When the roadmap's open items are exhausted, this file gets its final
entry summarizing what "done" meant, and the discussion happens over it.

## M5.2 stage A - the turning substrate and the facing ladder (code 1648ce9 + this docs)

**The door moved from the ribbon into the command.** M3.2 stage E's
machine-kind law only darkened UI cells; since stage A
`CreateOperation` itself refuses a kind whose family the document's
machine cannot run - turning work on a mill, milling work on a
lathe, nothing refused on a mill-turn - BY NAME, naming the kind,
the family and the mount that opens the door. The table is data:
one new `family: Family {Mill, Turn}` field on the KindInfo registry
row, so M5.2's ~20 remaining turning kinds land the gate for free.
Considered and dropped: refusing at GENERATE only - a created-but-
never-generatable operation is a ghost in the tree, and the law
says validate early. The ribbon's darkening stays as a courtesy
reading the same table; the command door is the law.

**An unstated machine is a mill.** The admits law
`(_, MillTurn) | (Mill, Mill) | (Turn, Lathe)` defaults the missing
document to today's world - every existing test, project file and
golden keeps its meaning, and only mounted `.mch` files can open
the turning door. Dropped: `Machine::kind` defaulting to MillTurn
("it can probably do both") - a guess about steel is exactly the
silent wrong answer the directive bans.

**The facing kernel is a construction, not a check.** The CL point
is the insert nose CIRCLE'S CENTER held at `station + nose_radius`
along the axis, so the ball is tangent to the facing plane at every
point of the pass - it cuts exactly the flat it is aimed at and can
never cross it. No gouge test is load-bearing for this kind, and
the envelope verifier still judges the path like every other. The
ridge that set the parameter law: a pass removes precisely the band
`[s, s+2r]`, so an infeed over twice the nose would leave an
untouched sheet between stations - the kernel REFUSES
`stepdown > 2r` at the door instead of trusting a later scan
(a scan that measures the path against the model, and a standing
sheet is not in the model).

**No stepover is authored because none is missed.** The Facing
params carry tolerance, three heights, stepdown and two feeds -
one pass per station runs the profile's whole width, so the
stepdown IS the spacing. HSMWorks' facing has a stepover field
too; ours drops it as noise the moment the pass is a full-radius
line (the Trace kind's no-stepover precedent).

**Passes run inward only; the descent between rungs is a feed move
in air.** The spun work presents a fresh face only on the cut move,
the retract slides the ball tangentially off the flat it just made,
and the axial stationing move at clear radius travels at
`plunge_feed` (it is motion toward the spinning part, not over a
finished face). Rapids ride `r_max + stepdown + nose` - the rotary
rough's clearance law read radially, exact from convexity of the
distance-to-axis. Considered: retract-hop-plunge per rung like the
mills - dropped, a lathe turret does not Z-hop over a chuck.

**"Facing Plane Z" is the bottom height's word.** The panel reuses
the shared height editor under a kind-scoped tag; the name says
what the plane is (the face the last pass leaves), matching the
refusal texts that name it. The heights seam resolves it exactly
like every kind's Bottom Z - one law, one label per audience.

**`nose_radius` rides `Tool` as the inert-field pattern's third
member** (after `tip_angle`, `pitch`): every kind carries it, only
`Turning` reads it, and the BOUNDS are kind-scoped in `is_sane`
(`0 < nose <= d/2` for Turning, `true` elsewhere) so a retype never
refuses a mill for geometry it ignores. Dropped: `Option<f64>` -
the drill's `tip_angle` precedent showed the Some/None dance buys
nothing over "0.0 means the field is inert here", and the file
grammar keeps its flat numbers.

**The seed breaks the fold for one number.** `seed_facing` takes
every shared value from the `Carried` fold like its siblings, EXCEPT
stepdown: the mill's folded default (5.0) would meet the house
insert's 2r = 1.6 ceiling and refuse the fresh operation on its
first Generate. The seed authors the handbook rough-facing infeed
0.5, which stands under 2r of every TN row in the catalog. The fold
stays honest for every other retype target.

**The band radius is asked of triangles, not vertices - the
stubble bug, caught by reasoning before any test ran.** The first
kernel read each rung's infeed radius off the vertices inside the
window `[s, s+2r]`. A cylinder wall's triangles span the window
with ALL their vertices outside it - both rim rings elsewhere -
and the rung then started at the nose off the axis, cut its little
disk, and left a full-radius annulus of stubble STANDING ABOVE the
facing plane. No envelope verdict catches an under-cut: the path
never touched forbidden material, the material it failed to remove
is invisible to a program-vs-model judge. Silent wrong, the worst
class. The fix is a reach sweep: a triangle whose stations span
`[lo, top]` occupies a pass's window iff the rung start lies in
`[lo - 2r, top]`; its widest VERTEX bounds the whole triangle
(convexity of distance-to-axis over the hull of its own corners -
exact, not a heuristic), so the sweep is events-by-rung into a
max-heap of (radius, life) and overshoot is safe (starting further
in air costs a shorter feed, never a gouge). `profile_of`'s doc
now states where its own convexity promise ends: exact for the
WHOLE-BODY max, silent per station. The law test pins the
signature: every pass ends on the axis and starts beyond
`R + nose` - the wall's tangency - over a drum whose wall has no
vertex in the rung's window at all.

**The ribbon tip order: the tool list speaks first.** A Create
cell's tip checks the empty tool list before the family darkening
(imgui's swap, and the deeper trouble - nothing lights until a
tool exists, whatever the machine says). The lathe-darkening proof
runs on the demo document, which carries tools, so both laws stay
visible where each is true; the command door keeps refusing for
both reasons whatever the ribbon guessed.

**The door tests declare the kind by word.** The turning suite mounts
`Machine { kind: Some("lathe"), .. }` instead of an X/Z-only axis
table: the axis-inventory inference is the .mch's own truth (pinned
in the machine suite), while the family door only cares what the
document IS - declaring it keeps the door tests honest about the
table, not about a fixture's axis list someone may later extend.

**v33 is a pure step-up.** One new params tag (`facing`), one new
tool-kind word (`turning`), one new serde-defaulted key
(`nose_radius`, 0.0 = the inert every mill already meant) - no v32
file can carry any of them, no existing shape changed, and the
sane door refuses the default for the kind that reads it: a
declared turning tool WITHOUT a nose is a mathematical point, and
`validate_kind` turns that into a named Corrupt before the world
is touched.

## M5.2 B - profile roughing and finishing (decisions taken unattended)

**The rung ladder is radial, not axial.** G71-style concentric
roughing reads in handbooks as a sequence of offset passes; we state
it as distance-to-part: rung j rides at d_j = nose + leave +
j*stepdown, outermost first. The alternative - facing's axial band
ladder reused along the station - was dropped: on a profile with
steps it leaves a standing shell in the shadow of every shoulder
(the same silhouette-blindness that stage A's stubble law caught on
the drum), while a radial shell is eaten by theorem: rung j's nose
clears exactly the band [d_j - nose, d_j] of distance-to-part.

**stepdown past 2 * nose is refused, leave past zero is required -
and the division of the two doors is deliberate.** The kernel owns
the geometric law (a ball of radius r clears a shell 2r thick,
facing's ridge ceiling read radially); the sane door owns only
"finite, positive, and a leave that is not negative", because a
negative leave is stock to REMOVE and only the finish pass owns the
profile. Putting the 2*nose ceiling in the sane door too would have
tied file-corruption language to a TOOL fact (the nose lives on the
rack, not in the params) - the refusal names the number and the
remedy either way.

**Tolerance is load-bearing twice here, and the budget splits
tol/4 + tol/4.** Facing `let _ = tolerance`; a profile ride cannot:
the silhouette's sampling and the offset's settling are BOTH chords
of promises the surface keeps, so each takes a quarter and the
surface left stands within tol wherever the nose reaches (two-sided
error, counted). The verdict reads the same tol, which is what makes
the finish path's `r_min` assert honest rather than decorative.

**The plunge-vs-traverse classifier is "same station, starting
above the ride's skyline" - copied from the motion suite down to
the app tests.** A ride legitimately spends radius at one station
when it steps over a shoulder's shadow; counting those as plunges
would make the wiring tests lie about the kernel. The clearance
lead is the only feed that starts ABOVE the path's own maximum
ride-radius, so that is the discriminator; an epsilon on
world-z alone was tried first and miscounted the shoulder
traverses - the motion suite's law was right and we adopted it
rather than inventing a second one.

**The profile kinds do not face bottoms.** With the window open at
the bar's foot, the ride hugs the cap arc and climbs the wall - it
never crosses the bottom flat. That is stage A's kind's ground
(Facing), and letting two kinds own the same cut would make the
document's op list lie about who removed the material; the wiring
test asserts the leave WALL (nose + stock off the neck) instead of
the disk traversal we first wrote. A user wanting the bottom faced
adds a Facing - the ribbon now lights both cells from the one
registry row each.

**The rough fixture is a flanged bar with a 3.5 neck, chosen against
the axis fit's ISO domed-ground gate.** A revolved test bar's flats
(a flange's faces) contribute their areas to the AXIAL eigenvalue
of the fit's covariance while the walls contribute W/2 each to the
transverse pair, so a fixture with too little wall and too much
flange gets its axis inferred as a dome and is refused before the
kernel ever runs. r6 wall / r3.5 neck / z -16..16 lands at
flats 223 vs half-wall 246.5 - inside, and the numbers are recorded
here so a future resize can check them instead of re-deriving.

**v34 is a pure step-up, like v33 before it** - two new params tags
(`profile_rough`, `profile_finish`), no existing shape touched: the
turning tool kind and its `nose_radius` arrived with v33, the
height DTOs are old news. A v33 file loses nothing being read by a
v34 writer, and the round-trip test mirrors stage A's grammar test
exactly so the next stage has the same pair to compare.

**Both profile kinds borrow Icon::Face in the browser tree.** The
no-new-asset law says drawn originals only when a generic glyph
does not fit; a silhouette ride IS facing's picture - the same ball
on the same bar, walking the wall instead of the cap - and Pocket3D
set the reuse precedent. An original profile glyph is a stage-C
decision if the groove kinds want their own.

**The bottoms are "Bottom of Part Z", not a new name.** Facing says
"Facing Plane Z" because its bottom is a plane it faces toward; the
profile window's bottom is where the ride PLUNGES IN and the
heights machinery (setup sheet, page editors, resolver errors)
reads one label list per Height slot - inventing "Profile Bottom Z"
would split the resolver's words for no user gain.

**A registry-count correction rode this commit: stage A added
Facing without bumping `stamp_follows_every_input`'s
`KindInfo::ALL.len()` pin (18 where it was already 19), and stage
B's gate caught the stale number at 21.** The comment in that test
always said the count is "the only stale number a stage can leave
behind" - it just happened to be true of the stage that wrote the
sentence's own era. Updated to 21 with the miss recorded, since an
honest count beats a quiet one.

## M5.2 stage C - grooving and the revolved blade verdict (code e880d56 + this docs)

**The blade kinds are THREE kinds, not one "Grooving" with a mode
switch** - GrooveRough (21), GrooveFinish (22), Part (23), wire tags
`groove_rough`/`groove_finish`/`part`. Considered and dropped: one kind
with a roughing flag (the ribbon cell and the seed would have to lie -
the finish carries no stepdown and no leave at all) and folding parting
into grooving (its bottom IS the parting plane and its verdict clause -
separation - is a different law; the family rows in `KindInfo` stay the
UI's truth without special cases).

**A grooving path is judged in the MERIDIAN, never by the envelope
scan** (`turning/revolve.rs`). A grooved part is undercut by design:
material stands beside the groove above the floor, out of every ball's
reach along Z, and the height-field law reads a ball riding the floor
as if the bar's own top were stock to remove - a phantom trench on
every correct groove. The blade's footprint is a BAND (everything
outside the tip radius, across the kerf's axial width); revolved, that
footprint IS the cut volume, and the question goes one-dimensional:
E(s) = the silhouette's own chord polyline, C(s) = the MINIMUM tip over
the moves whose open band contains s (the boxcar min-of-cuts: one pass
at the deepest floor removed everything above it, and a shallower blade
covering the same station added nothing). Where C < E the blade
gouged; where C > E a floor rests. The revolved verdict rides only the
blade kinds: facing and profile keep `Mode::Envelope` - the sphere
still speaks them correctly.

**The tangency promise is kept on the lattice's INTERVALS, not its
points, and real overlap means more than one HAIR (1e-9 mm).**
Projection noise lands at 1e-13 and no steel is that thin; a point law
made a parameter edge grazing a model lip a phantom floor (a graze
raised the interval's E to the shell and plunged the blade in air),
while a band edge standing exactly ON a wall station IS the flush
groove wall and must judge nothing there. One number, spelled once as
`revolve::HAIR`, serves the scan, the boxcar `span_max` and the
kernels' `rung` snap; between adjacent lattice events E is linear and
the covering set constant, so the scan takes its clause extremes at
each interval's two ends and is EXACT beyond the silhouette's own
chord budget.

**The separation law dropped its old clamp.** A through-axis plunge
(tip <= 0) silences the verdict only INSIDE its kerf band - what
stands there was meant to go - and everything right of the kerf keeps
standing, because the verdict's job is to check the path, not the
scrap that leaves with the cutoff. An earlier form clamped the whole
section right of any kerf, which went blind to a groove that was never
cut standing past the parting plane.

**A floor no band reached rests by the window's own shell - the
over-report law.** A missing pass must never buy silence: the whole
window's top stands as rest, blamed on the nearest move. Considered
and dropped: reporting "nothing covered" as a separate diagnostic -
the envelope scan's precedent (a judge that cannot measure reports the
gouge at the first cut, never silence) says one vocabulary, and
`Warning::Envelope { gouge_mm, rest_mm }` already carries the shape.

**The rung snap is a law, not a tolerance: a rung the noise left
within a HAIR of the floor IS the floor rung.** Without it the
ladder's `ceil` counts a rung the noise pushed a hair off the floor and
the FEED COUNT flips on the same coincidence the meridian law refuses
to judge by - the count tests then disagree with the verdict on which
floats are steel.

**Centers tile tangentially - step exactly one width - and the tail
closes on the window's own high end**, so the last center stands flush
to the upper wall even when the step does not divide the run (a 3.2
window with the 2.0 blade cuts two stations whose bands cover it
exactly; a 3.0 blade tiles the same window two as well). When a window
end coincides with a bar end the first or last center stands there
outright, spilling half a width into the part's own end air (air cuts
nothing; a center pulled inward would leave the shoulder's annulus
standing). Refused by name when narrower than the blade: "a groove
cannot fit where it was asked".

**Rapids travel the WHOLE BAR's widest radius plus tolerance**
(`profile_of`'s r_max, not the window's span-max) - the window may be
a groove in mid-bar, and a clearance plane computed only over the
groove would drag the blade through every standing shoulder it
traverses over. Considered: honoring a user clearance_z as the rapid
plane through the cut; the start point already rides it, but no
in-window height can promise clearance ALONG the bar, and a blade
through a shoulder is a crash.

**`top_z` on a Part is inert-but-carried** - it rides the trio purely
to keep the heights machinery (setup sheet, resolver, HeightRefs)
uniform; the parting plane is `bottom_z` and the kerf's column is the
model's own (its top is the span over the band, its bottom the axis),
pinned by a comment at both the params row and the kernel so "why is
there an unused top?" never becomes a bug report.

**The blade's width rides the TOOL digest, kind-scoped** in
`stamp::digest_tool` (`ToolKind::Groove => w(&mut h, tool.width)`),
not the params digest - a re-ground blade is a different cut whatever
the params say, and `status_of` reads Stale through it in both
directions of undo (the digest is a question about NOW, never a
remembered verdict). Mill tools keep an inert `width: 0.0` field
(`ToolDto` always serializes it - the inert-field pattern's fourth
member) so the file shape never branches on kind.

**The wrong-tool refusal lives at GENERATION, and names three things**
- the op kind, the tool and what the tool is ("... needs a grooving
blade", "'TN-1600-0R8' is a turning insert"). The CREATE door stays
family-only (any Turn tool may be attached before it is edited, as
with every kind) because the kerf's width IS the tool and only the
generator can say the geometry is impossible; validate-early still
catches what the params alone can state (a zero-height window:
`depth_sane` refuses at CREATE with "must cut downward" - the kernel's
"the height window holds no length of the bar" is the same law's
second line, reached only by callers that skip the door).

**Feed speeds must be positive at the sanity door even where the
kernel is inert to them** - a blade kernel's rapids carry no feed, but
`is_sane` is the FILE's truth too (validate.rs runs the same door at
load) and a 0.0 feed on a GrooveFinish row would load a file whose
numbers cannot post. The fixture tests discovered this as a refused
CREATE; the door is right and the tests carry the numbers.

**v35 is a pure step-up** - three params tags, one always-present
serde-defaulted `width` on the tool row, chained v34 -> v35; a v34
file loses nothing (blade kinds did not exist; every other tool reads
the inert 0.0) and no DTO shape was touched. The round-trip test pins
the grammar twice over: a byte-identical write-parse-write fixed point
and both loader refusal doors (a groove tool row with the `width` key
deleted, a part row with `stepdown: 0.0` - Corrupt, both, by name).

**The sim's `Mode::Revolve` stands the XY-plane laws down, not the
reach laws up.** A lathe path read by the envelope laws is all
degenerate contact - radial plunges "cross" at the axis, tangency
fills the section - so clauses (a) and (b) defer to the meridian scan
(motion's `revolve::blade_warnings`), while the pose-independent reach
laws (rapid heights, travel limits) stay exactly as the mill reads
them.

**The app-level blade fixture bar runs z -16..28 because the axis fit
is a gate the test must clear BEFORE the kernel speaks.** A stubby
capped cylinder is near-isotropic in the fit's normal-second-moment
eigen balance - the end caps and shoulders feed m_z until
`vals[0] > 0.5*vals[2]` trips the dome guard and "every axis fits this
model equally" refuses the whole suite. The ratio lands at 0.435 with
the extra 12 mm of tail (motion's revolve fixtures give their bars the
same room); recorded so a future resize checks it instead of
re-deriving. Related: a blade feed is asserted at CONSTANT STATION
with decreasing radius - it is a radial plunge - and the draft's
inverted form (constant rho) passed nothing it claimed.

## M5.2 stage D - threading on the revolved wave verdict (code 2647832 + this docs)

**Threading is the cut ON A MODELED SCREW, and the model owns the
phase.** The kernel reads the silhouette for the first CONTIGUOUS run
of samples standing at or inside the model's own floor (deep dip
tolerance away from the crest) within the window, and centers the
run's first V on that dip's center: a ground root floor reads as its
flat's center, a sharp V as its one point - either is the groove the
lattice must land in. Considered and dropped: a phase parameter (a
number that can only contradict the drawing - the model is the truth
the pass is asked to agree with) and threading a smooth bar (a real
helical thread's silhouette is a FLAT crest, because its flanks twist
through every phase on the way around; there is nothing to aim at, and
`thread` refuses by name - "threading cuts a MODELED thread (a
revolved V section); a smooth bar has none to find"). The verdict
then judges the thread exactly as its drawing states it - profile
representation, the same law the turned profile rides. A cut too deep
or too shallow FOR the model is the verdict's to convict, never a
reason the phase cannot be read.

**The insert's V, not a boxcar, is the footprint** - the wave clause
of `revolve::scan` (`BandMove::wave: Some(cot)` with
`cot = cot(A/2)`). A band of half-width d from a center cuts its floor
deeper by the flank slope's cotangent times the distance along the
axis, so at every station the floor stands at `tip + cot * |s - c|`
inside the crest line - a V, and the scan's boxcar becomes a wedge.
The lattice is the helix's OWN: every second half-turn arc end returns
the tool to the frame's meridian, and both endpoints of a
constant-radius half-turn read the same depth, so the END's station IS
the center the V belongs to; radial plunges state the run's first
center and rapids (which cut nothing) reset the parity count.
Considered and dropped: judging arcs by chord midpoints (an odd-count
crossing stands at the ANTIPODE - the V there is the neighbor's), and
running the envelope scan (crests undercut by design; the sphere
cannot speak a helix). The crest law (`clip_shell`) stands: a form
floor ABOVE the blank's own surface measures nothing - the crests are
where the passes never reach, and there the shell, not the floor, is
the part. A model the judge cannot even frame reports a gouge at the
first cut - a judge that cannot measure never buys silence.

**Two geometry doors, both named at CREATE.** `insert_width < pitch -
2*tol` - a V wider than its own turn spacing would stand its flanks in
the NEIGHBOURING groove's steel ("grind narrower steel for a
single-point thread"). And `half * cot + tol >= depth` - the
full-form reach: an insert whose flanks stop short of the crest leaves
crests standing that NO pass can touch, and the verdict would spend
the whole thread length reporting one rest ("single-flank passes are
not this kernel's to speak"). Multi-start, whirling, and single-flank
threading are all outside this kind by these two lines, stated as
refusals rather than shipped as silent limits.

**A thread run past the axis is boring work** - `root <= 0` refuses
("no core is left to stand between the flanks; that is a hole, and
holes are boring work"), and a `depth` at or under the model tolerance
refuses too - a valley indistinguishable from its crest is not a
thread anyone can verify.

**The axis must stand plumb: LEAN_MAX 1e-6** - a helix is circles in
planes SQUARE to the spindle (that is what "one turn per pitch" means
as a path), and a bar leaning past a microradian makes the pass an
elliptical rise this kernel cannot promise. Considered and dropped:
tilted-frame helices (mill-turn M5.2 G territory) and quietly
projecting the circles onto the tilted frame (the pitch drifts by
cos(lean) - a silent wrong answer, the Prime Directive's own words).

**The V is TOOL steel, the lead is WORK intent.** The insert's crest
`width` and its flanks' included angle (parked on the tool row's
`tip_angle`, as the drill parks its point angle) ride the TOOL digest
- kind byte 8, both fields hashed - so re-grinding the steel marks
every op that rides it Stale through undo both ways. `pitch` is NOT
infeed geometry, it is the thread being cut, and it rides the PARAMS;
a Thread tool row carries `pitch: 0.0` inert. The seed numbers are
handbook numbers: pitch 2.0 with depth 1.08 is the ISO crest-truncation
relation (`H = 0.866 * P`, depth `5H/8`), and infeed 0.4 puts exactly
three rungs on it - 30 deg of included V at that depth clears the
width door (the TD catalog row's crest width is `0.866 * P`).

**v36 is a pure step-up** - one params tag, one tool kind word,
chained v35 -> v36; no DTO shape was touched, a v35 file loads and
loses nothing (threading ops did not exist). `Threading` carries the
trio (clearance/top/bottom as Heights) and no finish_tol - the Revolve
kinds are judged by the meridian scan, and a tolerance the scan
already spends on its lattice would be a number that does nothing.

**The sim's law (d) joins laws (b) and (c) in the Revolve stand-down.**
The rapid law asks, of a lateral rapid's XY column: does material
STAND ABOVE the tool along it? For a mill that is exactly right. A
lathe insert is a POINT in XY - its entire form lives in the (rho, z)
meridian - and the answer the column gives for a thread's final
retract is structurally wrong: above the tip circle the core stands
forever, while the actual tool slides OUT OF ITS OWN CUT, flanks
coincident with the surfaces they made (the wave's slope IS the
model's slope at the V). The gate caught it at rho = root, theta = a
polygon vertex of the 16-gon section: every chord covering that point
lies at a plane whose material disc CONTAINS it (the island clause
waives the section boundary), so the column surfaced at the box
stock's top and convicted a physically clean pull-out. Blades never
tripped it because no blade tip ever stands exactly ON a floor
cylinder's circle. Considered and dropped: a 3D column for revolved
paths (the meridian scan already IS the exact law there - two juries
on one question), and a tolerance patch at the island clause (the
clause is right, the PROJECTION is the wrong geometry). The turning
rapids' safety promise is the kernel's own, as it has been since
stage C: radial exits from cut stations and traverses at
`rho_clear = r_max + tol`, asserted by every family's path tests; the
meridian (wave) verdict still judges every cutting move. Fixture
steel (d2) stands for EVERY mode unchanged - holding steel is a box
and the XY law speaks boxes truly.

**The post says nothing new** - a threading path is feed arcs and
rapids, which fanuc.cps already writes with its ordinary circular and
linear laws; thread-synchronous cycles (G32-family single-point
motion, lead-word F sync, rigid tapping) are a machine-vocabulary
question deferred to the M5.3 native CNC-format work, not a reason to
teach the CPS engine a letter it cannot verify.

**The tool editor's golden regenerated** - the ToolKind list grew its
ninth row label ("Threading insert"); the pixel diff is the combo,
verified pure before UPDATE_SNAPSHOTS.

**The catalog's four groove phrasings are the two blade kinds.**
Rows "Roughing groove"/"Turning groove" are GrooveRough (the stepped
center ladder, roughing the way a multi-pass groove op roughs);
"Finishing groove"/"Turning single groove" are GrooveFinish (one
plunge per center to the band's floor - what a single-groove op IS).
Considered and dropped: minting duplicate kinds for the phrasings
(the ribbon cell and the seed would lie, stage C's own words). Part
flips "Turning parting", Threading flips "Turning threading";
adaptive roughing, boring, chamfer/taper/form/multi-pass, radial
drilling and hole recognition stay open for stages E-G as planned.

## M5.2 stage E - the promised-face rides (code 9f38881 + this docs)

**A contour op is a promise over a MODELED contour - the ride
follows the model, never the authored numbers.** Chamfering and
taper turning state a cone (an angle, two diameters) and the kernel
feeds it to the DOOR, not the path: every silhouette segment
strictly inside the window must stand within tolerance of the
authored line or the op refuses by name; inside the window the ride
is the profile finish's offset walk along the model's own skin. Why:
the verdict measures the pass against the MODEL - a ride that
chased a cone authored BELOW the skin would gouge and print an
honest-looking program, and silence about that is the Prime
Directive's worst case; a ride above it just leaves rest. Considered
and dropped: generating the surface from the numbers and riding that
(what threading's phase door already refused for the V - the model
is the truth the parameters promise), and refusing on vertex samples
alone (a short window on a straight wall holds no sample; the door
walks SEGMENTS - a chord differs from a line only at an overlap's
ends, read at both).

**A vertical silhouette segment (a face, a shoulder wall) deviates
from the authored line only as far as the line stands OUTSIDE the
radius interval the face sweeps.** A chamfer window that clips a
shoulder is not a lying model - the tool visits that face
tangentially at its plunge, and the S_IN band (0.1 mm) keeps
tangent-touching end faces out of the promise. Cost to change: one
clause in `worst_dev`.

**The chamfer's angle states the slope's size; the FALL comes from
the model.** Both readings (down toward either window end) are
measured and the honest one judged. Why: the parameters never said
which way the cone faces, and pretending they did would refuse
half the honest programs. Considered: a signed angle or a direction
enum in params (a number the model overrides anyway - noise).

**A straight taper (equal diameters) is allowed and rides as a
cylinder skim.** The law forbids lying about the model, not boring
about it; the door still judges, and a square promise over a square
bar is true. Cost to change: one if at the taper door.

**The multi-pass ladder is the spring-pass midpoint formula - ride
k of n at `d = nose + stock*(n-k)/n` - capped at 64.** Half of what
the previous pass sprang back is the handbook's own finishing rule
and makes every earlier ride strictly inside the last one by
construction; passes >= 1 is the create door (a program with no
finishing ride leaves the stock standing - the profile is the
finish's to own), the cap is the kernel's (past 64 it is a polishing
sequence). Stock to leave >= 0 with the same reasoning (negative
leave is stock to remove, and the ladder eats to the leave, not
through it). Considered: an authored per-ride distance schedule (a
UI for people who want it, not the default law).

**`Mode::Envelope` for all three, and that is not the blade
stand-down in disguise.** The envelope scan's own law counts rest
only where a pass PROMISED to roll over (two band contacts; single
grazes and untouched columns are law, not rest) - so on a windowed
face ride it measures exactly the skin the door judged, and the
bar's untouched shoulders outside the window buy their silence from
the LAW, not from a verdict weakening. The gate is the usual
tol + cell^2/(2r). Cost to change: a Revolve-style meridian clause
if a contour kind ever needs undercut judgment (it does not: no
contour ride undercuts - the offset stands outside the skin).

**Adaptive roughing (turning) - row 127 - ships ABSORBED by the
multi-pass ladder, not as a duplicate kernel.** Audit: adaptive
clearing exists because in MILLING, constant XY steps are wildly
uneven LOAD. On a lathe the work spins: the chip is the feed and
the radial step, and a constant rung step IS constant load; the
only turning engagement variability is contour-driven dwell, which
the rung ladder's per-station spans already equalize. A separate
"adaptive turning" kind would differ from multi-pass only in how
the rung depths are chosen - a strategy dial, not a law.
Considered and dropped: minting the kind anyway (two registry rows,
one verdict), and deferring to M6 (the row would stay open at Phase
5 close for a feature the ladder already is). If a user needs
area-paced rungs, the honest place is a stepdown POLICY inside
multi_pass - RECOMMENDED flag for discussion.

**v37 is the arrival law restated a sixth time - three params tags
and nothing else.** No tool-kind word (the Turning insert is the
whole steel), no new key on any row (the nose was filed since v33),
unknown tags refused by validate_kind; a v36 file steps up with one
apply.rs clause. Cost to change: none - it shipped.

**Form turning stays OPEN (E2), and it is a TOOL-kind decision.**
(Landed at E2 exactly as chosen - see the E2 section at the end of
this file.)
A form gauge is a crown - a meridian arc of its own - so the honest
implementation is `ToolKind::Form` + the revolve verdict's floor
bending from the wave's linear cot to the arc's sagitta (the wave
clause is the special case); riding it on the Turning nose would
let the envelope ball convict a correct crown cut or waive a gouge,
the phantom-trench law's other half. Chosen: do it as stage E2 with
its own commit, not stretched into E1's - the registry row 135
stays 📋 until then. Landed as chosen at E2: both calls named here
stand - a new FLOOR clause, not a new judge, and the crown riding
the TOOL - and the row is ✅.

**The envelope's gouge law moved from a column floor to a facet
distance - the M5.2 E phantom made the case and the geometry closes
it.** `facet_gouge` measures each model triangle against each
ball-center instant as the distance of two convex sets minus `r`
(Ericson's reduction, public literature), where the verdict scan
used to read "Dexel floor below the column's model height". Why: a
height field CANNOT be honest about three things a lathe part is
made of - a tilted flank (the vertical reading is inflated by 1/cos
of the surface's tilt), a vertical wall (its columns carry no height
at all, so a floor never "falls below" one), and an under-pass (a
tangent chamfer ride stands the bar's whole length under its own end
cap in columns the cap legitimately overhangs - the old law printed
56 mm of gouge on a path no ball ever cut into). The distance law
reads 0 on every flush ride BY CONSTRUCTION (distance == r, an
exact sqrt on the suite's floors), keeps the r/2 mixup's ~3 mm, and
keeps the dome meshes inside the gate (chord sagitta tol/4 < gate).
The lattice no longer speaks in this verdict at all; the discretiza-
tion left is the generator's own chords. Considered and dropped
first: a span/island law (sweep-span overlapped against a second
surface per column - it fixed the overhang and made the tilt WORSE:
a 45-degree graze's span ∩ island is the ball's own crown depth,
nonzero and phantom; worked counterexample, then reverted), and a
min() of the two laws (keeps every false conviction of either).
Pair discovery is a thick-line band walk over facet bins (slice
window grown by r, cross extent grown by r - proof in the module
doc), over-budget is a stated refusal the engine turns into a
proves-nothing warning, never silence. The Dexel sweep stays exactly
where it was: the display sim; it is dead only in the verdict.

**Turning CL positions are NOSE CENTERS, and the envelope now says
so per kind (`envelope_scan_centers`, lift 0).** The scan lifted
every stored move by `+r` in Z - true for a ball nose (tip directly
under center), a lie for a turning insert (the generator's offset
walk stores the nose center, as the taper tests' `10 + nose` radii
prove). On the chamfer's cone the lie walked the ball r(1-1/√2)
into the skin and read r/√2 = 0.57 mm of gouge that never happened;
on faces tilting the other way (a taper's, a flat's) the same lift
walked the ball OUT and made the verdict vacuously blind - passing
tests proved neither, because a silent clean and a true clean print
the same line. Why the seam is a function choice and not a Move
field: the convention is a KIND property (a stated nose_radius
means the generator walked centers; `ToolGeom::nose_radius` is 0.0
for every mill), so law (f) picks the scan by the same boolean that
picks the ball - one fact, read once. Considered and dropped:
lifting moves at the verify call site before the scan (two owners
of one offset), and a tip-convention rewrite of the turning
generators (every lead-in, slide-out and post writer in the turning
files positions centers; the G-code is right BECAUSE they are).

**Seeds: 45 degrees / dia 20->16 / stepdown 0.5 + leave 0.25 + 3
rides, tolerance 0.05, heights carried.** The two-click defaults
must run clean on the suite's bars, and the app suite proves it
(the_seeds_of_the_contour_kinds_stand).

## M5.2 stage E2 - the crown gauge (code 2d38617 + this docs)

**A form tool's meridian footprint is the sagitta, and the floor
clause bends for it exactly as the wave's did.** `Floor::Crown(R)`:
the floor at distance d off the crown's center stands at
`tip + R - sqrt(R^2 - d^2)`, clamped at d = R (past the arc there is
no steel - the door says no band stands there). The thread's wave is
the small-angle special case. Why a new FLOOR and not a new judge:
stage D's revolve scan already answers "what stands between the
band's edges", and the only form-specific fact is the shape of that
answer - one clause in `floor_at`, every law (chord overlap, gate,
crest) shared. Considered and dropped: stamping the crown as a
Turning nose circle (the phantom-trench law's other half - E1's own
entry said so; the ball would convict a correct crown and waive a
gouge), and a general "profile of the edge" param (the arc is what a
GAUGE is; a general edge is CBN-form work, not a registry row).

**The plunge depth is READ, never authored: `tip = max(chord - sag)`
over the events the SCAN judges - and the min/max inversion E2
caught on the way is the whole lesson.** The first draft sank the
crown by `min(material(x) - sag(x))` "because chord-minus-arc is
concave so its minimum lives at the ends". Both halves were wrong
together: the concavity is right but picks the ENDPOINTS OF THE
WRONG SIDE - min is the deepest claim-safe tip only if every chord
is read where the lattice will judge it, and the lattice judges the
move's own CENTER (lattice() pushes m.a/m.b) - so the law is max
over each real-overlap chord's clipped ends AND the center when a
chord spans it, which is exactly the set `scan` will measure, floor
= tip + sag >= E at every one of them, gouge-free BY CONSTRUCTION.
With the min, a matched crown gouged at every non-governing event
and, worse, `material()`'s both-sided vote returned the bar's 10 mm
skin claim at a wall station, so the crown sank to ~9.66 and never
reached the valley at all. A gauge that cannot match the model then
stands shallow and the verdict says so with `rest_mm` - never the
kernel hiding a rest by sinking blind. Considered: reading model
vertices (a tessellated arc's vertices miss its belly; the chords
are the model's own polyline truth).

**The crown rides the TOOL's `nose_radius` and the band its
`width` - the "specialty field, inert elsewhere" law for the crown,
and the arrival law for the KIND (`form` in v38 files never
appeared, so v37 steps up with serde defaults and no migration
beyond the version row).** Why reuse: a form gauge IS a ground
radius, and the digest already hashes nose_radius globally - so
re-grinding the crown marks every form op Stale with no new digest
byte, and the kind-scoped `width` row (stage C's) does the same for
the band; the two numbers a gauge is made of are two rows the wire
already files. The stamp's width row had to become KIND-SCOPED
(nose_radius was global since v33): an end mill's width is 0.0
everywhere and a scoped row means re-grinding one gauge never
stale-marks the mills. Considered: new fields crown_radius/band on
params (steel belongs on the tool row - a second opinion in the op
that can disagree with the mount is exactly the drift M4.2's digest
exists to catch).

**The form verdict clips floors at the BLANK's crest, not the
window's.** `scan`/`judge` gained an `Option<f64> crest`: the shell
clause ("a floor above the blank measures nothing - the shell owns
what the gauge never reaches") needs a blank to compare against,
and a lone crown's band sits INSIDE the bar: its own span_max is
the valley's rim, not the skin the crown stands off. Passing the
max radius of the whole silhouette made the too-steep/too-wide
mismatches rest OUT LOUD as the kernel doc promises; None keeps the
thread and blade paths byte-identical (their window IS the crest's
stage). Cost to change: one parameter through three call sites.

**One plunge per MODELED valley, centers from the model's own
low-floor runs (threading's phase law, per-run instead of lattice),
and a smooth bar refuses "nothing to form" by name.** The op
promises a formed surface; inventing a crown from params over a
plain bar is the silent-wrong-answer door E/D already shut for
threads. More runs than MAX_RUNGS refuses to split the window, a
floor on the axis refuses as "that is a hole, and holes are boring
work" (boring is stage F). Feed and plunge_feed ride the params
(feed INERT in the kernel - a radial sink has no programmed
station-advance - but real to the post, the same honesty rule as
the blade kinds).

**v38 is the arrival law restated a seventh time** - one tool kind
word, one params tag, zero new keys; the v38 grammar round-trip and
three loader doors (a gauge with no band, a band past twice its own
crown, a form op with no plunge) ride project_roundtrip like every
prior stage. The tool editor's golden regenerated - the combo grew
its tenth row and the CATALOG one entry (FG-0600-04); the pixel
diff was verified as exactly the dock scrollbar nub (2 px x 31 px,
content one row taller), pure combo/catalog churn before
UPDATE_SNAPSHOTS.

**The envelope's facet-distance law gains its fourth
configuration - the segment pierces the face - and a buried path
now reads the saturation it always deserved (E1 fallout, found
because E2's gate finally ran the binary E1's Gate map never
named).** `dist_seg_tri` proposed only endpoint-in-face and
edge-to-edge candidates; those ARE complete for two SEGMENTS, but
segment-to-TRIANGLE has one more configuration - the segment
crossing the face's interior, where no endpoint or edge can
witness the touch (Ericson 5.1 with the reduction finally
finished). A feed run straight through the solid therefore read
its crossed wall's EDGE distance: the through-the-cube fixture
reported 1.0 (r - 2) where the truth is r itself - 0 distance -
an under-read, i.e. the one sin. The law now returns 0 on a
verified in-plane crossing and the verdict saturates at exactly
`r` for any path that buries its centers; magnitude beyond r
never claimed. Considered: signed half-space depth (would read
the 5 mm "trench" the retired column law promised) - dropped: it
needs consistent winding the scan is nowhere promised, and a
winding-blind orientation test regrows E1's phantom convictions.
Same edit aligned `EnvelopeReport.gouge_mm`'s doc to the intrusion
wording the struct header already carried.

**The cone tol-gate verdict test had been red since E1's birth, in
the lane no gate ran: its planted 0.1155 was the scan's own yardstick.**
E1 rewrote the gouge measurement to facet truth AND replaced the
cell-derived chord budget with tol/4 (killing the phantom trench
the r/8 lattice dug - cell/4 = 0.094 of pure measurement artifact,
plus ~0.010 of 96-gon planarization: the very 0.1155 the test
commented as "the generator's own chord error"). The fix that made
the law honest made the test's evidence vanish, and the ignored
release lane it lived in never ran. Rewritten to what the law
actually promises: the clean rings stay silent at tol 0.01 (the
phantom-trench guard, stated instead of assumed), while the same
rings SUNK 0.09 - a real deviation, ~0.064 of surface inside the
envelope - sit under the 0.1 promise they were generated for and
convict at the 0.01 budget whose floor still resolves them. The
sink helper must keep arc payloads (a G2's center is XY-only, so a
z-shift leaves it authored): flattening the rings to chords made
"semicircle arcs" into diameter lines through the cone - and the
new crossing law convicted that fiction at r, loudly and
correctly. The fiction's conviction is the fix's proof.

**Gate-map blind spot, now law, not lesson: a kernel crate's
verdict lane must be named in the consuming suite's Gate map.**
E1 changed sim's envelope law; app's verify header listed only
app:: modules, so the narrow gate picked no envelope binary -
debug AND ignored-release lanes - and the regression rode two
stages home. verify.rs's map now names sim::stock_sim's verdict
lane explicitly; the same audit applies wherever a stage re-laws
a crate other suites consume.

**Form-fixture law for the turning suites: bars span z -50..50.**
A short squat revolve (the D-era 56 mm barrel) tips the axis-fit
second-moment ratio toward the dome refusal ("every axis fits this
model equally") as soon as extra annular faces join the meridian;
lengthening the bar is what makes a 16-gon read as a revolve.
Twin-valley fixtures keep >= 12 mm of land between crowns for the
same reason the band door keeps half <= R.

**Adaptive row 127 audit CLOSED here**: E1's ABSORBED entry stands
re-checked against the shipped kernel - the multi-pass ladder
(`blade::rungs`, spring-pass midpoints) is what the row points at;
no adaptive clause lives anywhere else in `turning/`.

## M5.2 stage F - boring on the inside twin of the envelope law (code edf562c + this docs)

**Stage F's offset law is stage B's theorem through the mirror, and the
verdict is the E scan unchanged.** `profile_offset_in` folds the wall's
claims with MIN where `profile_offset` folds the silhouette's with MAX:
a center curve standing at distance >= d BELOW every piece of the hole's
inner wall is a bar whose swept ball never enters the steel, by the same
construction-proof that carries every OD ride - no new warning type, no
second envelope code path, because an envelope scan already measures a
ball about points and does not care which side the material is on. The
considered alternative, a `BoreEnvelope` verdict of the revolve family
(undercut-free the way a blade's is), was dropped for the reason the
twin rides state: a bored wall is not undercut by design - it is a
single offset surface of the model's own wall, and the E-configured
facet distance measures exactly that relation from inside or out.
`ToolGeom::nose_radius` now speaks for `Bore` as it does for `Turning`,
which is what makes the scan read the kernel's centers as centers.

**The axis-vertex filter at the inside offset, with its vacuity proof.**
`inner_wall` answers a solid station with its axis end (radius ~0) -
that is what makes the doors able to name a bar with no hole - and
handing those points to the vertex-circle claim would let its <=-branch
apply to a wall at radius 0 standing a nose's distance off the ride
window: a false fit refusal ("the wall runs at radius 5.885" when the
bar is legal). The filter (`q.1 > HAIR`) drops the points, and the
theorem that makes it LOSSLESS is the floor door's own: a rejection at
an axis vertex guarantees the nose can reach that vertex from inside
the window, i.e. the doors passing means every axis vertex stands at
least a nose beyond it, i.e. its sqrt(d^2 - ds^2) claim is never real
where the ride lives. What was considered and dropped: branching on
rv ~ 0 inside `profile_offset_in` - the mirror function has no business
knowing which of its caller's points are on the spindle centerline;
and skipping the <=-disjunct entirely - it is exactly the claim that
holds a rim's tangency exact at the window ends (the through-hole test
leans on it).

**Reach-door numbers name the obstacle, not the window.** A floor the
nose cannot clear refuses with "raise bottom Z to at least fl + d" where
fl is the closest AXIS VERTEX at or below the window's bottom - the
floor face's own station - falling back to s_lo + d only when the solid
names no axis vertex. The earlier window-edge-plus-nose wording was
conservative but wrong about which number is the tangency: typed into
the pane, s_lo + d leaves an unexplained gap, and at a tangent bottom
it refuses a legal touch. Same law mirrored for the ceiling
(`>= s_hi`-closest axis vertex minus d). Proof the vertex exists in
every rejection: the steel region containing the test point is a face's
interior whose axis-crossing boundary face ENDS on the axis, and every
revolve vertex station is a wall point by construction.

**The axis-parity doors: three-angle MOELLER-TRUMBORE vote, never an
edge-count parity.** A 16-gon tessellation's station polygon crosses a
ray an even number of times whether the axis stands in the hole's air
or in solid metal (the chords close), so the first instinct - count the
wall's claims at the station - is a fallacy the suite proves out loud:
a PLAIN BAR's min-envelope reads its own skin as a wall, the offset
would happily ride tangent IN steel, and the E verdict measures
nothing wrong there (tangency is not gouging). The doors therefore ask
the mesh itself - odd/even crossings from the axis point, voted at
0/120/240 degrees so a ray grazing a vertex rim cannot swing the answer
alone, majority 2-of-3 - at the window ends, its middle, every vertex
inside, and at the ball's axial reach past both ends. Every failure
mode this stage could ship - a silent ride in a bar with no hole, a
window punched through steel, an unreachable floor - is a refusal with
a station number before a path exists to be wrong.

**BR-1000's holder: the catalog's lathe law, stated in data.** The
first bore runs convicted every ride move with a ShankHit from law (c):
cy() (the cycle-tool builder, drilling-era) gave the boring bar a MILL
holder stack - a Ø44 x 35 column at flute+shank above the tip - and
(c) reads bands as columns along Z about the move's XY, while a boring
bar's steel lies RADIAL on a lathe: an OD column 22 above the tip is a
collision no bar has. Chosen fix: bring the catalog row into the tn
family's stated convention (`holder 0/0 - the turret IS the holder`),
which is already why every other turning kind verifies silent; law (c)
itself stands unchanged, because a REAL mill-side boring head (M1.6's
cycles, live-tooling F2) genuinely does have that stack and genuinely
does collide with a deep hole's wall. Considered and dropped: gating
(c) down for Turn-family modes - a data row's wrong steel is not the
law's fault, and the gate would blind the mill-turn machine that
drills bores on a live tool. The honest cost, owned: reach law (e) now
reads 60, not 95, for a cycle drilled with BR-1000 specifically -
deeper mill bores with that catalog entry report ShankHit where the
phantom holder once excused them; over-reporting, never a hidden gouge.

**Wire tag `boring_turning` while the label is "Boring" - the arrival
law states itself.** The tag is the variant's snake name, not the
ribbon's word (the round-trip door refuses `bore_turning` and any
label-derived guess, as it has since `facing`); ordinal 29, no new kind
word beyond ToolKind::Bore's filed `bore`, no new Tool keys - the
global nose_radius row (v33) already convicts a re-ground bar through
the TOOL digest, which is the stage's one genuinely new digest edge:
ride radius is TOOL steel, so a re-grind marks the op Stale by itself
and the regenerated ride stands deeper, flush with the MODEL's wall -
verdict silent both ways, and undo of the grind marks it Stale again.

**v1 scope, once more honestly clipped:** one ascending ride, no rough
ladder inside the hole (spring passes on a bore are stage G-or-later
work if the ROADMAP ever asks), single hole per op (the split-tube
refusal says it by name), and the radial lead-out at plunge feed - a
second feed dial for the lead was considered and dropped: the kernel's
one-plunge shape makes plunge_feed exactly that dial already. The file
seam law too: the kernel arrived as a flat 489-line `bore.rs` over the
~400-line ceiling, so it ships as `turning/bore/{mod,doors,wall}.rs` -
the split is a pure code move landed in the stage's own commit, before
the tree ever saw a release: the kernel entry and the ride, the parity
doors, and the MIN-fold wall are three subjects, and `revolve.rs`'s
487 lines are the cautionary tale, not the precedent.

## M5.2 stage F2 - radial drilling and the turned solid read sideways (code 32d3f27 + this docs)

**Recognition is the Z pipeline rotated, not a second pipeline.** The
cylinder primitive (`drilling/cylinder.rs`) states the three
axis-aligned candidate axes, the transverse plane they induce, the Kasa
least-squares circle (public fitting lore, Kasa 1979), and the
edge-weld law: facets join a component only across a shared edge whose
normals agree within cos(dtheta) >= 0.7, so a tessellated wall welds
along its length and never bridges the dihedral where it meets a face.
`classify` then reads EVERY law the Z-only original stated - span,
rim, fit tolerance, the hole-vs-boss vote - off the candidate's own
permuted coordinates (`sp(along, u, v, ...)`, one backward `coord`),
which is the whole of the new doctrine: a drilled hole is a closed
round wall, wherever its axis points. The fold `merge_z` runs unchanged
on the snapped holes; a counterbore on a turret axis merges exactly as
it did on a mill's.

**The doors ask the mesh, and the parity vote is three-angle
Moeller-Trumbore - never an edge count.** A station open to air
crosses the wall facets an ODD number of times along its inward ray;
solid metal answers even. A 24-gon's chords close, so any vertex-
count parity is a fallacy in both directions (the F stage proved the
same on the OD side); the ray votes at three orientations, 0/120/240
degrees, majority 2-of-3, so a grazing vertex cannot swing a door.
`ray_open` starts OUTSIDE the whole mesh (past `mesh_min`) and counts;
`hits.is_multiple_of(2)` is the open answer inverted to "covered" -
stated once, read by every door in the kernel.

**The traverse law is inflation math, not sampling: chord min >=
hop_s.** Between holes the rapids must clear the turned solid by the
cutter's own rim plus the machine clearance; the kernel states it in
closed form - `end_s = stock_r + max(clearance_d, margin)`,
`hop_s = stock_r + max(hop_d, clearance_d)`, and a traverse segment
between poses keeps its min distance at `hop_s * sqrt(2/(1+dot))`,
which for the 90-degree station change is exactly `hop_s * sqrt(2)` -
so flattening to chords cannot dip a hop inside the clearance tube.
Considered and dropped: sampling the rapid every 5 mm and checking -
an approximation that can be tuned into a silent miss, where the
algebra cannot be. The same law is what the drilling cross tests
prove by measuring the chord samples OUTSIDE `stock_r`.

**`Mode::Radial` stands (a), (b), (c), (c3) and (d) down - the height
field cannot see a tunnel.** The vertical-axis reading of a horizontal
chain is a fiction four times over: XY crossings convict the legitimate
intersection of two cross-drilled holes (both are kerf); the distance
law convicts the plunge chord crossing the silhouette head-on (d = 0
is the hole's MOUTH); the leaning-column enclosure of a fully
horizontal band is a vertical slab over the part's own walls (the bore
convicts itself); and a retract sliding out along its own kerf reads
`low < surface(q)` under solid stock - a RapidInStock that is the
tunnel, not a plunge. Each law's truth for a posed horizontal move is
already PROVED by the kernel's construction (doors measured on the
mesh, the inflation traverse above), exactly as `Mode::Revolve` let
the meridian scan own the lathe's truth. The fixture laws (c2)/(d2)
stay in every mode: they are 3-D boxes, no height field in them, and
steel keeps no tangency courtesies. The cycles stay empty for a
radial chain, so the reach law (e) is a no-op here by construction -
the depth truth rides each hole's own `floor_d`.

**The pose tag says tip->shank, so a hole's tag is the NEGATED plunge
direction - and that sign is a traverse-safety fact, not a label.**
`cl`'s law (`moves.rs`) states a move's axis as the unit vector from
TIP toward SHANK; the live tool plunges ALONG `dir`, so its shank
stands BEHIND the tip and the tag is `-dir`. The station hop's first
rapids ride the PREVIOUS hole's pose, so a flipped tag aims the
retract's clearance leg INTO the part instead of out along the way the
tool came in. The motion cross suite now pins the reading (hole 1's
inward -X plunge wears +X) and the app test asserts every move in the
chain carries it.

**The app-side bar mesh is closed by necessity - the slicer convicts
what the ray laws tolerate.** Motion's `radial_bar` fixture deliberately
carries coplanar double surfaces (a full -X quad plus a punched annulus
on the plane): its ray/edge laws ride that fine ("the through hole
reads through via the edge law at smin == mesh_min"), but the DOCUMENT
silhouettes the same entity with `slice::project`, and every chord end
there must be shared by exactly two chords - the double surface is a
non-manifold contact and the op refuses at once. So `drilling_cross.rs`
ports the bar as an honest closed singly-punched solid: same walls,
floors and holes, every face one surface. The UI test's first attempt
was a PARAPHRASE of that port and detected zero holes through a
winding drift in its hand-rolled ring/floor helpers (kind_of was
green; `cross_holes_of` answered `Ok([])`) - the lesson recorded as
law here: the verified builder is ported verbatim, never retyped.

**v1 scope, stated as refusals.** Mixed lists (Z holes AND cross holes
on one op), a mill document asked to drive cross holes, and a Bottom
Z plane over radial holes all refuse BY NAME at command-adjacent
depth - the family gate itself did NOT move (MillTurn admits any
family, per stage C's law; the live-tooling question is the machine's
kind, read once at `machine::kind_of`). Cycle records stay Z-only:
there is no G8x radial vocabulary yet, so the chain is the single
truth and the post's cycle hooks see the holes they can honestly
count. The standoff for a curved entry maps `air = (clearance -
R).max(1)` from the hole's own rim, and the machine check that gates
it is the mounted `.mch`, not the default.

**v40: the wire grows an optional `cross` key and pure-Z files stay
byte-identical.** The DTO carries `#[serde(default)] cross:
Vec<CrossHole>`; the round-trip test writes the key only when a file
has radial holes and asserts its ABSENCE for a Z-only document, so
every pre-F2 golden file still matches byte for byte. Undo/redo ride
the list like any params field: deepening a blind floor's `floor_d`
marks the op Stale through the params digest alone, and one Ctrl+Z
restores it.


## M5.2 stage G.1 - full part orientation, one placement law (code 0a26f3e + this docs)

**Orientation needed no new schema: a pose IS the model's Location.**
The ROADMAP row asked to lift the M3.2 placement flip to full
rotation. Chosen: a `MoveModel` command writing `Location { pos, rot }`
- the quaternion the geometry reads already transform through. The
payoff is the free half of every law: `stamp.rs` already hashes pos
AND rot for an `SrcRef::Entity` source, so a pure spin marks every
dependent operation Stale with zero new code, and the project round-
trip already serialized it. Considered and dropped: an `Orientation`
component beside `Location`, or an orient-specific stamp - both make
a second truth about where a part stands, and second truths drift.

**One placement validation, not two that drift.** `check_location`
(the unit-quaternion and finite-position gate) was made crate-public
in `commands/fixture.rs` and `MoveModel` adopted it verbatim, so
`MoveFixture` and `MoveModel` refuse the exact same garbage for the
exact same reason. Considered and dropped: copy-pasting the
`SetWcsOrigin`-shaped check into the new file - three copies of a
validation is one bug waiting for someone to fix only two.

**Pages own their verbs: the refusals say who places what.** The
command constructor refuses `Machine/Table` (derived from the `.mch`
- not a part you can move), a tagged fixture ("the Fixtures page
places it"), and a WCS entity ("the Work Offsets page places it"),
each by name at construction so nothing half-entered the history.
Considered and dropped: letting the command move anything and having
each page filter the entity lists - the history would then hold
mutations the document's own laws contradict, and undo across two
pages would replay the lie.

**Tait-Bryan degrees at the UI, the quaternion in the world, R = Rz
⊗ Ry ⊗ Rx.** `CommandKind::MoveModel` carries roll/pitch/yaw in
degrees because those are the numbers a machinist types; the command
converts once at the queue arm via `quat_from_euler` and the world
stores the rotation. The arm refuses non-finite angles BEFORE the
conversion: the axis-angle builders substitute identity quietly, and
"your NaN yaw was dropped" is exactly the silent reinterpretation the
Prime Directive forbids. Considered and dropped: storing Euler angles
in the world - composition-order-dependent, and byte-exact undo over
gimbal drift is a trap.

**Quarter-turn buttons are commands, not draft pokes.** The Models
page's six turn buttons pre-multiply a 90° axis turn onto the current
quaternion and apply the move immediately; the draft re-syncs from the
world like every other pane on the document version. Considered and
dropped: buttons that only edit the draft until Apply - a rotation
the viewport shows but the history cannot undo is a bug by the
everything-is-a-command law, and the turn is exactly what a
mouse-drag orbit would want to become later.

## M5.2 stage G.3 - the opposite-station detour, and the hop plane's side (code b9c06ca + this docs)

**A 180-degree station pair travels over the bar's end face, not
through it.** No hop radius saves the chord: two points on opposite
columns at any equal radius straddle the spindle, so the closest
approach is 0 - the F2 refusal stood because the machine really has
no legal straight traverse there. With the stock's Z top known the
path lifts on the OLD column, indexes the turret in the clear,
swings above the end face (a plane no radial chord can reach), and
descends on the NEW column. Considered and dropped: a B-axis rotary
move to bring the stations adjacent - the kernel's live tooling is
axis-aligned v1, and inventing a rotary traverse to dodge a linear
problem is the kind of cleverness the refusal doctrine exists to
prevent.

**The detour needs a witness, not a guess.** `stock_z_max` rides
`CrossParams` as `Option<f64>`: `generate` measures it from the same
mesh vertices that give `stock_r`, `None` keeps the old refusal
verbatim, and a NaN top is turned away at the door - "no detour can
be proven clear of a bar whose height is a guess". The swing plane
adds `clearance.max(margin)` on top, the margin carrying the tool
body's own rim below the tip line.

**A hop plane is a radial distance on the mouth's own side.**
`start_d` had read it as a signed coordinate: a station whose mouth
sat at negative x parked at POSITIVE x - through the spindle,
mid-air, silent. G.3's -X test hole made the old lie visible while
writing the swing assertion; every F2 mouth happened to sit at
positive coordinates, so nothing had caught it. The fix takes the
side from the mouth's coordinate sign (a centered stock's radial
mouth never sits at 0; the fallback is the station behind the tip),
and `a_negative_station_hops_on_its_own_column` pins both the chord
law and the first rapid's side. Considered and dropped: leaving the
signed reading for positive-only callers - recognition hands
negative mouths to this code the day a real bar is drilled, and a
latent through-spindle rapid is a gouge with a calendar on it.

## M5.2 stage G.2 - part load/unload: the stream carries intent, not motion (code ef20e19 + this docs)

**One program is one part.** The lifecycle's scope was settled before
any field was: a Parting operation's program describes cutting ONE
part off a bar - load, cut, unload - so the events bracket the
section (PART LOAD right after it opens, PART UNLOAD right before it
closes). Considered and dropped: a part-count list on one program
(bar-fed runs of N parts) - the count is a job-shop/MES number, not
geometry, and a real feeder brings its own counter; the operation
answers for this one part only.

**Events are stream records, never moves.** A bar advance puts no
path into CL and nothing into the sim - a rod sliding is not a
cutting move, and letting it into the collision model would fake
metal nothing cuts. So `Record::Part { loading, advance }` joins the
SECTION family: `onCommand` never sees it, `onPartLoading` /
`onPartUnloading` are the whole contract, and the PRELUDE defaults
voice the intent as a comment - visible to the operator, harmless to
any controller. A script with a real feeder dialect overrides them
exactly as it overrides any other hook; the engine itself never
invents an M-code.

**The signals are operation params and they ride the stamp.**
Considered: a component on the operation (params are where authored
numbers live, and these change only the POSTED program), and the
setup level (two parting operations on one document may legitimately
differ - a second chucking job). They dirty the cache exactly like a
feed does, even though no geometry reads them: the stamp hashes all
three numbers. Grown in at v40 with serde defaults and NO version
bump - absence means silence (`false/0.0/false`), the fixed-point
pattern `feed_opt` kept since v14: the save states the learned keys,
so a second open cannot drift them.

**ADVANCE rides the LOAD alone, and the door says so.** The
serializer writes it only on load lines (microns, the lattice law -
spaced, joined, or keyed spellings all round-trip identical); the
parser refuses it on an unload by name, because our writer never
emits it and a hand-edited stream that does says something confused.
An advance of 0 is legal and means the ACT alone - feed the bar,
state no measured number - which is also the seed's shape: a fresh
Parting operation says nothing the controller wasn't told to expect.
A negative or unmeasurable advance is refused at the command door,
not deep in the post.

**The feeder got its own tab, Part-kind only.** No cutting tab names
a load/unload signal (Geometry/Heights/Passes/Leads & Links/Feeds
all read wrong for it), and a tab empty for every other kind is the
dead-tab the section law forbids - so "Machine" follows the
`Leads & Links`-only-for-Contour precedent exactly. Considered and
dropped: Feeds (it voices the machine, not a velocity) and the stock
page (stock is what is there; the feeder is what the machine does
about it).

**A revolved path is refused, not reinterpreted, by the program sim.**
The gate's first live posting of a Part op came back "gouge: program
cuts below the model in 112 cell(s), worst 38.00 mm" - the mill's
dexel heightfield reading a parting kerf as a plunge far below the
bar's top (38 = 28 − −10, exactly the misreading). If the gate lied
about the sever, the feeder signals - the whole point of Part params -
would be unreachable in the app, so this clause rode G.2 rather than
a later stage: `simulate_document` refuses any program containing a
`Family::Turn` op, naming the op and pointing at the revolved verdict
that generation already made binding (M5.2 C's law, now gate-visible).
Chosen over teaching the dexel a lathe frame (a real revolved sim is
M5.3-later work) and over excluding only the turning ops' moves
(a program is judged whole; half-judged verdicts are the two-agreeing
laws this repo keeps refusing). The refusal lands in the gate's
own documented silence arm - nothing judged, nothing claimed - and
Deviate states the reason on demand.

**The ladder caught a G.1 test bug, fixed at the test.** G.1's
placement command shipped with `move_model_refuses_other_furniture_
and_garbage` asserting garbage poses AFTER the test had tagged the
block a fixture - so the furniture door (the higher truth: it names
why this entity is placed elsewhere) spoke first and "quaternion"
was unreachable. The command's law stands as written; the asserts
moved before the tagging. Considered and dropped: reordering
`MoveModel::new` to check the pose before the entity doors - it
would disagree with `MoveFixture`'s identical order for one test's
convenience.

## M5.2 close-out - the tag and the vehicle, version untouched

**`m5.2-done` was tagged and the release vehicle built without a
version bump, because the bump is not this milestone's to make.** The
repo's law, read from `git log Cargo.toml`, is that the workspace
version moves only in a dedicated `chore(release)` commit at the
milestone that owns a `Release 0.x.0` label - 0.1.0 at M1.7, 0.2.0 at
M2.3, 0.3.0 at M3.3. M5.2 sits inside the 0.3.0-to-0.4.0 window; M5.3
carries the `(Release 0.4.0)` label, so 0.4.0 lands at that close-out.
The precedent is exact: `m5.1-done:Cargo.toml` still reads 0.3.0. What
M5.2 owes is the annotated tag on `e9db438` (after the heavy measuring
lane ran green in release) and `cargo build --release` on stable into
`target-release/` - the hand-test vehicle - both done. Considered and
dropped: bumping to 0.4.0 now (a number ahead of the milestone that
delivers it is a version that lies) and a version-less tag (the
vehicle would point at no named state).

## M5.3 A - Incremental recompute: the digest memo that lives on the entity

**The per-frame wall was the stamp re-deriving whole-mesh digests, and the
fix is a memo keyed by M3.1's revision counter.** Staleness is a live
question the UI asks every frame per visible operation: the stamp's
source arms read `facets_of` (a full Vec clone), hash all triangles for
the content key, walk the faces, and fold the digest - so a 10M-triangle
model cost N ops x 2 full traversals per frame just to answer "nothing
moved." Chosen: a per-entity `GeoSig { rev, sig }` component holding the
newest derived signature, valid while `rev` equals the live revision
counter. Considered and dropped: thread-local content cache (entity ids
alias ACROSS worlds - test binaries build many, and a recycled address
could hand a stale digest to the wrong world); storing the digest in the
project file (a stored stale-flag in disguise - the AGENTS law); GPU-side
digests (that is stage E's terrain, not this bullet's).

**The counter became enforceable by moving the increment INTO
`set_facets` - the one write path.** It used to be command-side bookkeep-
ing, and six landing sites (fixture, setup, set_stock, delete-undo) never
moved it - which is exactly why M3.1 could honestly call it "display and
save only." A memo keyed on a lying counter is a silent-wrong-answer
machine, so the increment now rides the write itself: a site cannot
forget to move a key it never sees. Commands that RESTORE a past revision
(`UpdateModel::invert`, `ImportModel`'s redo, the project loader) pin the
counter right after landing, paired with the exact bytes that revision
carried - the snapshots make that pairing honest, and it is what lets an
undo/redo oscillation answer with the original digests (values identical
to the fresh path - asserted, not assumed). The loader's pin became
UNCONDITIONAL: a file's remembered counter must win over the load-time
landing's bump, so a pre-v20 document still reads rev 0 at load (the
roundtrip suite's v19 case, unchanged).

**This is a stored FRESH, not a stored stale - the Prime Directive read
mechanically.** Staleness is still decided by comparing the stored stamp
against the live signature; the memo only decides when the signature
must be re-derived, and every hit is value-identical to the fresh path
(FEATURES_CACHE's "correctness independent of hits" law). The hit path
additionally requires the `Facets` component to still be MOUNTED, so even
a misused pin - a reused revision on unmounted geometry - reads `None`
like the fresh path does, never a resurrected digest (there is a test for
exactly that adversarial pairing).

**The hsmw salt went with it: `hsmw-signature-v1` ->
`camcraft-signature-v2`, plus six test temp-name renames - the last M4.3
residues.** A signature-salt rename moves every stored digest once, so
documents saved under the old salt read their operations Stale exactly
one time and settle for good - the stamp.rs salt-rename precedent ("the
one-time Stale read... working as designed"). Considered and dropped:
keeping the old salt as v3-compat (a hash salt is not a compatibility
contract - the wire magics are, and those stayed); a two-slot memo for
oscillation (frames read one stable revision; the single slot replays by
pin, and the second slot measured as dead weight).

Gate notes: all 44 app/ui/post suites green including the .nc/.cl golden
byte-stability lanes (the salt rename shifted no golden - digests ride
stamps, not files). `operations` (app) needs ~490 s fully parallel, over
the old 240 s batch window: contention, not regression - solo rerun
green; worth remembering when batching ladders.

## M5.3 B - Threaded generation: the seam where the world goes out of scope

**Chosen: a collect/run split with the type system as the law, over any
form of shared-world threading.** `&World` is `!Send` (a flecs design
fact, not an accident), so "generate on worker threads" had three
shapes: hand the world around as a read lock (flecs forbids it, and it
would serialize every read site anyway - the parallelism would be a
lie); clone the world per worker (a memory fork, and "which clone is
newer" has no honest answer); or read the world ONCE on the caller's
thread, pack the answers into an owned `Send` job, and generate from
the job. Third one. `GenJob` cannot smuggle a live read because it
cannot hold a reference - if it compiles, the collect phase provably
saw everything. `generate = run_job(collect_job(..)?)` keeps the
one-op road byte-for-byte the old behavior, which is why the entire
existing suite passed untouched over the new code path.

**rayon, new to the workspace, for the batch finish.** Chosen over a
hand-rolled pool with join handles: `into_par_iter().collect()`
preserves input order, so `parts` comes out in tree order exactly as
the sequential loop wrote it, and work-stealing plus panic propagation
are not ours to get wrong. The batch law - the reason ordering was
worth a sentence: constructors only READ, so a batch's world is frozen
for the whole run and running jobs in any order, or in parallel,
cannot change what "before" means. The new test
`threaded_batch_matches_the_serial_loop_bit_for_bit` runs a three-op
stale program both roads over one model revision and asserts paths,
warnings and stamps equal per operation - the law as a gate, not a
comment.

**Error precedence rides positionally, not by cloning.** `GenError` is
not `Clone` by design, so each arm-scoped world read
(`section_z_of`, the picked region, the contour selection pair, the
drive chains, the re-machining mask) is taken at its generation-time
call site during `collect_job` and rides the job as a stored
`Option<Result<_, GenError>>`; `run_job` consumes it with `.take()` at
the exact statement the live call used to make. The `??` law: one `?`
unwraps the Option-tripwire layer, the second the arm's own answer -
and `unreached()` names itself rather than cutting a silent shadow if
the call structure ever drifts. A stored error therefore surfaces
exactly where the serial path surfaced it, same precedence, without
any error type growing a clone.

**The re-machining mask is `Arc<PriorState>`, and `region_for_src`
retired.** A Dexel height field is big and borrowed anyway - `prior_state`
resolves once on the collect thread and every worker shares it by Arc.
`region_for_src` no longer exists: its selection guard and tilt lock now
live in `collect_job` (where they decide WHICH precomputes to run), and
its world-free dispatch in `region_for_job` - `region_core` unchanged
underneath. Noted honestly: the preview path (`region_of`) keeps its own
inline selection arm with a different kind-exclusion list; that
preview/generate divergence predates this stage and was not touched.
The skipped-list order has one documented deviation: staging failures
surface before run failures, while the old loop reported in pure tree
order - the SET of skipped names is identical, and no test or UI path
depends on the list's order.

**Goldens stayed byte-identical because the parallelism is BETWEEN
operations, never inside one.** The per-kind kernels were not touched at
all; clippy's `type_complexity` on the new job field was resolved by
widening `selection.rs`'s existing `SelectionGeometry` alias to
`pub(super)` and reusing it - one name for the tuple, no second spelling
to drift. Gate: full app/ui ladder green (290+ tests), both clippy lanes
clean, `git status crates/app/tests/golden` empty.

## M5.3 C - Part transfer: an intent on the stream, a count on the machine

**Chosen: `Record::Transfer` as a sibling arm, not a generalized
`Record::Part` payload.** The one honest alternative was growing Part's
`{ loading: bool, advance: f64 }` into something that could also mean
"from spindle A to spindle B" - a tagged payload, or two dead fields on
every feeder line. Rejected: every existing Part site (the parser body,
the two PRELUDE hooks, the golden-proven serializer, the tests) stays
byte-unchanged, and the stream keeps its one-word-one-meaning grammar -
`PART LOAD`, `PART UNLOAD`, `PART TRANSFER` are three sentences, not one
sentence with mood flags. The cost is one enum arm and one dispatch; the
benefit is that nothing that ever worked had to work again.

**The stream vocabulary is general (`from to`, any stations, 1-based in
the order the file states its heads); the app's emission is the one
convention it can honestly make (`1 -> 2`).** `Dump.part_transfer` is a
bool because the app's Part op is one handoff of one parting op -
multi-station choreography is a future automation story, and it grows
into a stream that already speaks it. Noted: the stations are ORDINALS,
so they ride plain integers and touch no unit law - the micron lattice
belongs to lengths and feeds, and parsing `2` as `0.002 mm` is the kind
of unit lie the coolant-rate refusal (M3.3 C) named itself to prevent.
A missing, zero or non-numeric operand refuses by name: which spindles a
hand-edited line meant is not a thing the reader may guess.

**Capability is the program gate's question, never the post engine's.**
The engine voices what the stream states (comment default + one
dedicated hook, `onCommand` never seeing a lifecycle record - the
SECTION-family contract, kept); `check_document` owns "does this machine
have the second hand the comment asks for", exactly as it owns travel,
rpm and the RTCP-tilt refusals. A post that blocked on capability would
make the same stream mean different things in different directories; a
gate that never checked it would let `(PART TRANSFER 1->2)` voice an
invitation to reach for a spindle that isn't there. The machine answer
comes from the file: `Machine.spindles` counts spindle-stating `head`
parts by walking the WHOLE kinematics tree (nested sub-heads count; a
head with no spindle is furniture; a file stating none keeps `None` -
the unstated-limit law, never a guessed `Some(1)`). It mirrors to the
script as `head.spindleCount`, and `script_props` reads it under the one
name `machine.spindles` through all three machine doors (mirror form,
serde field, raw `.mch` parts), so a dialect's `if (machine.spindles >
1)` gets truth about the file in every caller's grammar.

**Deviation recorded: existing Part ops read Stale once after this
upgrade.** The stamp folds `bar_transfer` like every post-visible signal
(1.0/0.0), so its first appearance changes cached stamps the same way
M5.2 G.2's feeder fold did - the salt precedent, working as designed,
one regenerate and they are fresh. Gate: 380 tests green across
post/app/ui (post crate on the ladder for the first time since the
split), clippy `-D warnings` clean on all three, all goldens
byte-identical.

## M5.3 D - In-process inspection: the ask on the stream, the verdict at the post

**Chosen: the deviation verdict lives at the POST, composing every
blade leg of the program into the final cut and measuring it under the
strictest authored ask.** The alternatives, in the order they died: a
per-op max-deviation riding the cached path - rejected on paper, it
over-convicts rough+finish programs, because a rough's left floor is
removed by the finish the probe never sees as absent; a dexel
deviation read (v1) - rejected as the wrong venue, the program-sim
grid is a verification layer whose Z-height field is blind to a
lathe's meridian; the same-op scan at generation (v2) - rejected BY
MEASUREMENT, the cutoff-kerf law makes a clean parting measure
exactly zero deviation, so the verdict was never true, it was
vacuous. The composed final-part scan (v3) is where the three died
into: the boxcar-min union the M5.2 C scan already makes of one op's
passes, now of the program's - and leave zero BY CONSTRUCTION, because
a roughing promise is what the PROMISE forgives, never the part. The
honesty test that killed the per-op design is now the tests'
strongest pair: the same rough-leave that REFUSES the post alone
POSTS silently once a finish answers for it.

**The stream voices the ask, the gate makes the decision, and nothing
new rides the cache.** Record::Probe <-> `PROBE <um>` <-> onProbe <->
Dump.probe_tol: intent, the same grammar as the loader family, the
measurement protocol itself staying the script's dialect. No
Toolpath.dev, no PathDto field, no schema change - the verdict is a
derived read over the program's truth (the cached paths, exactly what
program_ops validated) and lives where the program's derived reads
live: verification_gate. The gate speaks problem STRINGS like the
gouge and fixture lines do; v2's Warning::Probe was reverted, the enum
being a file-format contract (project v3 cache warnings), and a
variant added only to be netted into one gate line is a type paying
rent for a sentence.

**The choreography is LOAD..cut..PROBE..TRANSFER..UNLOAD** - the
measure sits after the last cut and before the hands move the part,
which is where a real probe touches it. The number IS the switch:
0 asks nothing and costs nothing (silence buys out of the scan
entirely), and the budget rides the stamp like every post-visible
signal, so editing it stales the op though no geometry reads it.
The door floors a nonzero ask at 0.1 um - the world's best machines
- and the budget also chords the scan that judges it (a quarter per
sample edge), so a sub-floor ask was never authorable in the first
place.

**Jurisdiction: the boxcar-blade family only - Part, GrooveRough,
GrooveFinish.** The threading's V and the forming's crown compose
floors the same scanner reads (their Floor variants stand beside the
blades in the lattice), but no ask rides them yet: honest silence
beats half-measurement, and the ask is authored on the Part because
parting is where a lathe program handles the finished part. No
machine-file clause: a `.mch` states nothing about probes, and the
unstated-limit law says an unstated limit checks nothing - what is
judged here is deviation, not hardware.

**Blame is composed, not global**: the scan's `at` index rides the
program's move space, so the verdict names the guilty leg and its own
move number, the asker, and the act (re-run the named op, or run the
pass that takes the steel off) - and the tie-break keeps the smaller
`at`, the earlier op, because when two passes promise the same
station the first one is the story. `BandMove.half` made the
per-move blade width explicit for this: single-tool scans store the
same number on every move (their law byte-identical, every existing
verdict unchanged) and the composed scan lets each leg keep its own
width.

**The gate's timing law, bought at this stage.** flow5d's debug run
measured ~426 s and the gate's first pass read it as a silent
deadlock. It never hung - generation completes in seconds; the time
was sim verify, ~400 s of it, and a per-law lap-timing bisect named
the thief: law (c3)'s mid-turn sweep re-asked the three pure column
laws (`in_stock`, `surface`, `part_at`) at every (state, sample)
pair - 800 posed moves x 40 sweep states x the flow path's
tens-of-thousands of per-plane island samples, every re-ask the same
answer to the same question. Committed apart (6f9d453): one memo per
path, keyed by the column's exact bits; the max-severity verdict
cannot see the reordering, and 407 s became 1.5 s. Two rules come
out of it, as law: a test that "hangs" gets TIMED, not assumed - the
Prime Directive's slow-but-refused road runs through the ladder
fitting its budget (~5 min debug, AGENTS), so a slow test is a bug
to fix, never a lane to cut; and a suite timeout must exceed the
slowest single test's measured wall on the machine it gates - when
the same binary passes at one patience and fails at another, the
suspect is the timeout, not the code.

Gate (M5.3 D): two independent ladder runs, all green - 37 rebuilt
test binaries 793 passed / 0 failed / 28 ignored, and every fresh
binary across app/motion/post/sim/ui likewise 0 failed; clippy
-D warnings clean on the five touched crates; goldens porcelain
clean, the .nc and .cl sets byte-identical; flow5d's debug wall
426 s -> 19.5 s, the operations suite 460+ s -> 68.5 s.

## M5.3 E - Large models: the shared mesh, the streaming door, the sparse grid

**Chosen: facets stored once behind `Arc<[Triangle]>`, 72 bytes each;
mesh and stream, not mesh plus copy.** The alternatives: keeping the
stored normal on the triangle (96 bytes) - dropped, it was dead
weight the winding already answers and `normal()` now recomputes at
the sites that ask, so no verdict moved; a `Vec<Triangle>` per holder -
dropped, the model plus its clones in every system is exactly the
"coexists with its copy" tax the stage exists to kill. The one law
that bit back and got recorded as toolchain lore: `Arc<[T]>` does not
implement by-value `IntoIterator`, so `x.into_iter()` on one resolves
THROUGH DEREF and iterates `&T` - silent, and clippy's
`into_iter_on_ref` is what names it; two test helpers were riding that
deref before the ladder caught them. `.iter()` is the honest spelling.

**Chosen: the import door streams, and the binary/ASCII sniff is a
file-size law, not a content guess.** `solid` at byte 0 is ambiguous
(a binary header can carry it), so the reader declares binary iff the
file is EXACTLY `84 + 50 * count` bytes and nothing else matches; an
inexact `solid` file goes to the ASCII machine. Both flavors and both
read paths (buffer and stream) share one `AsciiFsm` and one
per-facet acceptance law, so `parse` and `parse_file` cannot drift -
the equivalence is a test, verdict-for-verdict, UTF-8 tail included
(the buffer validates the whole file, so the stream keeps reading
past `endsolid` instead of stopping early - a tail that is not valid
UTF-8 must refuse both roads alike). The file's declared facet normal
is parsed for finiteness and then IGNORED: orientation is recomputed
from the winding, the same everywhere, a lying header cannot lie its
way into a flipped shell. (Erratum, added at the box_walls finding:
"no verdict moved" was true of the lanes that ran at THIS close-out,
but the motion ignored lane - 27 finish3d + 1 flow measured verdicts -
did not run here or at M5.2 E, so the `9f38881` facet-distance law that
flipped `box_walls_are_pure_structure` to red went unseen for two
milestones. The verdict that moved was not this stage's doing; the
claim's silence about the ignored lane was the real gap, and the
close-out gate law now names it. See the box_walls section.) Caps: 30M facets, 4 GiB - past those the
door refuses by name; a 10M-facet round trip measures 517 ms to write
and 3.98 s to stream back in a DEBUG build, the peak being the facet
buffer plus one 8 MiB window, never twice the disk size. Per-facet
error tags ride a lazy closure: a 10M-facet stream allocates the
"facet 12" string only when it actually refuses.

**Dropped: the GPU-resident sparse voxel / SDF stock the roadmap line
suggests.** The law that killed it is the one M5.3 D just spent its
budget proving: the color map and the post gate re-read this field
and must agree to the bit - a driver's float is not a reproducible
witness, and the CPU dexel already answers 10M-facet grids in
seconds. The SDF road stays closed unless a measurement shows the
tiled CPU grid being the bottleneck at sizes we do not yet have.

**Chosen: the stock grid lives in 64x64 tiles, and the untouched tile
is not stored at all.** A `None` tile's value IS `stock_z` - the
fresh 2000-squared grid pays zero allocations where the dense `Vec`
paid 32 MiB before anyone touched it; a never-varying tile is one
number (`Uniform`); only tiles a cut reached carry 4096 cells. The
budget: `lower()` materializes a tile only when a cell ACTUALLY drops
(the old `if cut < top[k]`, NaN-safe the same way through
`partial_cmp` - a NaN cut writes nothing, exactly as before), `set()`
keeps the economy when the new value IS the tile's value, the
cylinder's air marks wholly-outside tiles with one number and runs
the old `hypot` cell law only on the ring the boundary crosses, and
model stock's `from_grid` collapses its uniform runs on arrival.
Equality is representation-independent by construction - two grids
are equal when their lattices are and every cell answers the same
number - which is what lets the tests keep their `assert_eq!` on
Dexels while a `None` and a `Uniform(stock_z)` differ in bytes and
never in verdict. The out-of-grid read answers NaN where the dense
index used to panic: the callers gate with `col`, and after this
stage not even an index bug can crash a verdict. `translate_finite`
skips `None` tiles by law because the caller moves `stock_z` itself -
they travel together; forgetting that would shift the untouched
lattice twice.

Gate (M5.3 E): two binary sets on the final tree, all green - 52
rebuilt app/motion/sim test binaries 830 passed / 0 failed in
parallel, 9 UI binaries 195 passed / 0 failed serial with
CWD=crates\ui; clippy -D warnings clean across sim/motion/app (three
nits caught and fixed on the way: the NaN-preserving `partial_cmp`
rewrite of `!(z < cur)`, `slice::fill` in `fill`,
`needless_range_loop` in the feed zip); goldens porcelain clean, all
13 .nc and every .cl byte-identical.

## M5.3 F - Scripting API: one verb table, two faces, JSON at the edge

**Chosen: one host door, `__cam_call(name, argsJson)`, with the `cam`
object a shim the VERBS table writes - and `cam.d.ts` generated from
the same table, drift-tested.** The alternatives: register each verb
as its own boa native function (dropped - boa 0.21's
`JsObject::insert` is pub(crate), so a built object cannot be handed
out under a name without a second path through the engine, and two
paths is where drift lives); a hand-typed `cam.d.ts` (dropped - it
rots the first time a verb's arity moves). The generator is ~10 lines
and one test; the law "a script can never see a method the header
does not name, nor a header line the runtime does not back" is then
structural, not a convention someone remembers.

**Chosen: the bridge across boa's edge is JSON text, and the closure
captures one raw pointer.** boa's host closures cannot soundly
capture an environment (only `Copy` captures are allowed, and `Env`
holds a World - neither `Copy` nor GC-traceable), so the pointer
stands in for the capture and every value crosses as serialized text,
never as a `JsValue` handle. The pointer's validity is an ownership
order, stated where it is constructed: `run` declares the
`Rc<RefCell<Env>>` before the `Context`, so the context and every
function inside it drop first. A leak-free alternative (thread-local
env stack) was considered and dropped: it works, but it hides the
lifetime behind a global and buys nothing a batch process needs.
Re-entrance (a verb calling back into JS mid-call) would break the
`RefCell` law, so it is refused by name in the dispatcher rather than
panicked - and nothing does it today.

**Chosen: refusals are recorded by the HOST, even when the script
catches them.** The dispatcher pushes `"{verb}: {reason}" into the
run's errors before it throws the catchable Error, so
`try { cam.operations("extra") } catch (e) {}` still exits nonzero
with a record. The alternative - errors are the script's problem
once caught - is what a JS runtime does and what a batch CI must
never do: a job that swallowed its failures is not a clean job. The
arity check rides the same road (it happens inside the borrow, so it
lands in `errors` too - the first version checked before borrowing,
and the law test caught it).

**Chosen: `verify` is a question, never a refusal - and the program
gate SKIPS while any operation is stale.** A stale document cannot be
judged (the gate would speak of paths older than the inputs), but the
script must still be able to ASK, so the answer is
`{ok: false, gate: {skipped: "why"}}`, never an Error - and
`check()` is `verify()` with the whole document, one judgment spelled
two ways by one body. `generate()` mirrors the app's two buttons
exactly: unnamed = every Never/Stale operation (what RegenerateAll
stages), named = force-regenerate whatever the status (what the
Generate button does); each rides its own `GenerateOperation`
command, so a mid-run refusal names the operation and leaves the
generations before it real and undoable.

**Chosen: the engine is the post's engine - one workspace-pinned boa
0.21.1 for both sandboxes.** Considered and dropped: a second engine
for scripts (rquickjs/QuickJS - a second memory-safety surface to
audit for zero capability we lack), and Node-with-a-bridge (a process
that cannot ship in the portable zip). The pin moved to
`workspace.dependencies` with a comment naming both consumers, so an
upgrade is one line checked twice. The sandbox law is airtight for
free in 0.21: there is no `console` builtin at all, and the four
`typeof` probes (console, fetch, require, the env pointer) read
"undefined" as tests - the only door is the verb table.

**Deferred: callback-shaped verbs** (`cam.verify({probe: fn})`,
per-operation JS hooks). Mid-verb re-entrance into JS while the host
holds the `RefCell` borrow is exactly what the dispatcher refuses by
name; a real use case would redesign the park/pull surface, not bolt
a second door onto the one. The parked `result()` covers the shapes
the chain cannot carry.

Gate (M5.3 F): all green on the final tree - 53 rebuilt app/motion/
sim binaries 846 passed / 0 failed (830 baseline + the 16-test law
suite `crates/app/tests/scripting.rs`), 9 UI binaries 195 passed / 0
failed serial with CWD=crates\ui; clippy -D warnings clean on
app+post with --tests (the first pass carried five
doc_lazy_continuation nits from a module-doc list and two needless
lives in the tests - fixed); goldens porcelain clean, every .nc and
.cl byte-identical, and the keystone test measures the law directly:
the script's post and the app's post are the same bytes.

## M5.3 G - The headless door: CLI over the script host, goldens that count

**Chosen: `camcraft-cli` is thin over `script::run` - the process lane
generates the script a human would have written (`cam.load; cam.generate;
cam.post; cam.verify`) and runs it through the same host the `script`
lane runs.** Considered and dropped: a native command path beside the
verbs (two dialects for one job - the project load/generate/post rules
would drift the moment one of them got a fix), and making the CLI shell
out to `post.exe` (a third argv to keep honest when the verb table
already speaks post). The door parses argv and maps verdicts to exit
codes; every world write rides a command through a real History exactly
as in a typed job.

**Chosen: the exit code is the verdict - 0 stood, 1 refused, 2 the
command line was wrong - and with no `-o` the verify report's `ok`
flips 0 to 1.** The scripting decision that `verify` is a question,
never a refusal, needed a home for CI: a stale or gated job must not
exit clean. Considered: always exit 0 and let the JSON speak (a
`set -e` lane passes a broken program - the silent-wrong answer one
layer up), and duplicating the gate rules in the CLI (they would
disagree with the host on the first change to either). Logs and the
parked answer go to stdout, refusal lines prefixed to stderr - the
same stream law every batch lane reads.

**Chosen: the regression goldens judge NUMBERS, not bytes - lengths,
counts, minutes, with a micron floor on the floats (TOL_MM 1e-6, the
quantization floor M4.2b already established) and exact equality on
integers.** Considered and dropped: a third byte-golden .nc (it proves
nothing moved and says nothing about how much a kernel shifted - and
13 of those already guard the post lane), and pure count asserts (they
blind the lane to the exact regressions it exists to catch: a millimetre
of drift in the dexel, a microsecond of feed math). The suite runs the
whole chain - import, stock, face, generate, the verification gate,
tool-list totals, post - and refuses the measurement if the gate would
block the program: a number over a path the gate stops is a bug, not a
golden.

**Chosen: the wavy slab is generated in code and written as BINARY STL,
so the import door's f32 read is the only quantizer.** Considered and
dropped: ASCII STL (the float's decimal rendering is a second
platform-dependent surface), STEP (the tessellator's chordal tolerance
varies with the platform's libm - the M4.2b lesson), and feeding an
in-memory f64 mesh via `from_mesh` (it skips the import door, which is
half the lane's point). 386 facets exact; the slab's polynomial top
skims under the face plane at every corner.

**Chosen: where the first draft was refused by the gouge gate, the
FIXTURE moved, never the gate.** Facing a FromModel stock with the
plane below the model's own surface cuts the part, not the stock - the
gate said so in 34,900 cells, correctly, and the fixtures went to a box
stock faced down to the model's maximum. Weakening a program-level
refusal to make a test stand is the silent-wrong answer wearing a
test's clothes; RECOMMENDED.md, M2.3 D, still governs.

Gate (M5.3 G): all green on the final tree - 58 app/motion/sim binaries
855 passed / 0 failed (846 baseline + 7 real-spawn CLI tests + the
2-test numerical lane), 9 UI binaries 195 passed / 0 failed serial with
CWD=crates\ui; goldens porcelain clean, every .nc and .cl
byte-identical (the default post path is untouched); clippy -D warnings
clean on app+ui with --all-targets (two nits fixed on the way: a manual
`.iter().any` over stdout bytes became `.contains`, and the slab's
9-tuple facet type got its `type Tri`). `regression_models` rides the
CI Golden step on Windows and the parity job alike.

## M5.3 close-out / Release 0.4.0 - the vehicle grows a second door

**Chosen: the portable zip now ships three binaries - camcraft-ui,
camcraft-cli, post - plus assets/posts, assets/machines, assets/ui and
assets/scripts (the scripter's types).** The release notes name
`camcraft-cli` as the batch door, so the zip must carry it; the version's
single truth stays the built binary stamped by cargo (0.4.0 at
`post.exe --version`), and the CI release lane copies `assets/scripts`
beside the rest (the drift test reads the same file the app embeds).
Considered and dropped: shipping the scripts folder only inside the app
binary (users own their posts and jobs - the files must sit on disk for
them to edit).

**Chosen: ROADMAP line M5.2 and M5.3 flip to done in the release
commit, with the summary rows quoting the stage letters** - every stage
was ✅ at its own commit; the milestone rows waited for the release
because their text is the release's table of contents.

Deferred (unchanged): Authenticode signing (no certificate owned), the
installer-vs-zip question, and the two open catalog debts (M2.4/M2.5)
that the notes now name plainly - a release's honesty is its limits
section.

Gate (close-out): the debug ladder was green at stage G (855/195); the
heavy release lane and the 0.4.0 release build run at the tag; dist
assembly is mechanical (copy + zip), verified by listing the folder with
sizes.

## M6.1 A - the Tokens table lands: visuals derived, chrome read through it

**Chosen: `Tokens` (14 colours + 17 geometry values) replaces the 14-field
`Palette`, and `visuals()` becomes a destructuring arm** - every colour
field named there and nowhere else, geometry routed through `style()`,
and a `const _` arm as the exhaustiveness guard: a new field that no
code path reads is a build error, not default-egui grey. Considered
and dropped: keeping `Palette` and adding a parallel geometry struct
(two tables that can disagree is the drift M6.1 exists to kill).

**Chosen: geometry is clamped at the seam** (`theme::clamp`: radii,
spacing, control/row/cell heights, glyph, fonts) so the M6.1-B theme
files can supply any number and the worst case is ugly-but-legal, never
a blown-out checkbox or a zero-height ribbon; the same windows are the
const guard's bounds for the built-in table. `ribbon_h(&Tokens) =
cell_h + 26` is the one derivation - shell, painted strip, and the test
fixture all compute it, so a theme that grows the cells grows the
ribbon with it.

**Chosen: `egui_tool_editor.png` golden regenerated for a 27-pixel
change** - measured, not asserted: diffing the two committed PNGs, one
hovered widget's two corner columns (8 px each side) moved. The law
behind it: egui 0.36's `Visuals::dark()` ships per-state widget corner
radii 2/2/3/2/2 - a HOVERED widget rounds one notch more than its rest
state, egui's own whim, not a themed number - and `visuals()` now sets
all five states from the one `radius_widget` token (= 2, the number the
painted cells and rows already draw). So the delta is hovered 3 -> 2,
one pixel of corner on one hovered button. (An earlier draft of this
entry and of commit `4dd77c0`'s message said "12 pixels" and blamed
`radius_window`/`radius_menu` = 6 against "egui's default 8"; the
vendored `style.rs` says window/menu are already `same(6)` in `dark()`
and no token touched 8 - the ledger and the audit trail carry the
measured story, the commit message is history.) The disagreement the
token kills is real, it is just this one notch: widget path and painted
path now agree on 2 by construction. The `.diff.png`/`.old.png` kittest
scratch stays out of the repo.

Also in this stage (unremarkable, recorded for the audit trail):
`apply_to` installs style+visuals together through egui 0.36's
`global_style` seam (one call, no half-apply), `shell::RIBBON_H` became
`#[cfg(test)]` (its only readers are the frame fixtures), and
`icons::ICON_PX` was deleted - the display edge is `glyph_px` now, and
`UPLOAD_PX` keeps its 2x comment.

Gate: lib 119 + egui_app 3 + shell 19 + gpu_render 7 + models 3 +
operations 31 + machine 6 + fixtures 7 = 195 passed, serial with
CWD=crates\ui; clippy -D warnings clean on camcraft-ui --all-targets;
the .nc goldens untouched (motion not in this diff).

## M6.1 B - the camcraft-theme/1 files: named refusals, clamped landings

**Chosen: the compiled-in default is the Rust `Tokens::DARK` const, not an
`include_str!` JSON** - the ROADMAP line said "include_str! the light and
dark defaults". Considered and dropped: shipping `assets/themes/default-
dark.json` and embedding it - that puts the same 30 numbers in two files
that can silently disagree, exactly the drift M6.1 A's single-table law
exists to kill. The goal the sentence serves (a binary with no assets
directory still themes correctly) is met harder by a const: it cannot be
missing. Light will land the same way, as `Tokens::LIGHT` in stage C.

**Chosen: ramp arrays refuse by name** (`"...carries a ramp array - not
implemented..."`). The ROADMAP offered `"#rrggbb"/"#rrggbbaa", or an array
for ramps` in the colors map. Considered and dropped: parsing one or two
entries of an array as a fallback - a theme that set a ramp and got a
flat colour half-applied, which is the Prime Directive's "never
half-apply" with extra steps. Ramps are a derived-contrast question
(stage D's hover/active steps); until then the refusal says so.

**Chosen: `"base":"light"` refuses naming M6.1 C** until `Tokens::LIGHT`
exists - accepting it would parse a file whose base cannot be rendered,
then silently theme off DARK. The refusal is by name in the battery; when
C lands the const, C deletes the arm and the battery case flips to a
support check.

**Chosen: unknown KEYS report, unknown TOKENS refuse**, with the
wrong-map hint: a `cell_h` under `"colors"` (or an `ink` under
`"geometry"`) says `belongs under "geometry"` by name. A paste mistake
becomes a sentence instead of a vocabulary dump. The check reads the
*other* map's vocab - the first run had it consulting its own map's list
(hint never fired); the misplaced-token test is what caught that.

**Chosen: caps before content** - 256 KiB byte budget enforced with
`Read::take` (a fat file refuses without loading it into memory), 64
entries per override map, 48-byte keys, 64-byte name, 64 discovered
files. Unknown top-level and descriptor keys collect into `Theme.notes`
for the switcher's honest line, never into refusals.

**Chosen: discovery takes an explicit directory** - no implicit
`assets/themes` CWD walk inside the reader. Stage C's switcher picks the
place to look (install dir vs dev repo is its decision, one seam); a
missing directory is a normal state (an install without assets), listed
as zero files with no diagnostic. The parse cache keys on mtime, so a
realtime swap costs one `stat` per unchanged file - `Arc::ptr_eq` is the
test.

Also in this stage: `serde_json` never lets an out-of-range literal
(`1e999`) reach the module's finite-number guard - it refuses at the
parse step - so the battery pins THAT text and the guard stays as
defense-in-depth. And a correction to stage A's entry: the geometry table
is 16 fields, not 17 (colours 14 + geometry 16 = 30; A's "17"
miscounted `font_row_suffix`).

Gate: ui full-crate ladder serial with CWD=crates\ui - lib 119 +
theme_files 9 (new) + the seven integration suites 76 = 204 passed, 0
failed (195 baseline + the 9 new); clippy -D warnings clean on
camcraft-ui after three lint fixes (`collapsible_if` -> a let-chain on
the cache hit, two `manual_contains`); the app crate is not in this diff,
so its ladder did not run.

## Phase 8 opened - Cutting order: the generator review & refactor

User report: a pocket done "adaptive" starts at the hole's outer edge
and cuts inward, and the helix entry ramps in the PLANE OF CUT instead
of down into the material - the tool plunges straight in. Verified in
`crates/motion` before writing anything: both pocket ladders apply the
`entry` family only at level crossings (`levels.rs` gates on
`crossing = !first && ...`, `ladder.rs` on `li > 0`), so the first dive
into uncut stock is always the fallback arm - a full-depth axial plunge
whatever the user chose; a Waterline/Adaptive plan's `passes[0]` is the
outermost ring, so that plunge lands ON THE FINISHED WALL and the rings
then march toward the center (wall-first, core-last: backwards for
roughing); and `dive_point` scores a round pocket's all-arcs ring plan
by containment - its longest chord's midpoint must sit inside BOTH
helix-radius-eroded leg regions, and ring chords have their midpoints
ON the boundary - so the crossing helix resolves None and silently
degrades to climb-and-plunge. (An early draft of this entry and of the
ROADMAP block said dive_point "demands a straight run"; entry.rs has no
straightness test - `windows(2)` scores every chord by length, and
containment is what bites. The ROADMAP text carries the fix; this
parenthetical is the audit trail.) `Adaptive` spaces rings by
the engagement law but is not trochoidal - the label overstates it.

**Chosen: a new ROADMAP Phase 8 ("Cutting order"), three milestones
(M8.1 roughing ladders, M8.2 finishing + planar families, M8.3
canned/posed/revolved), each generator visited one by one against three
questions (first engagement, pass order, link crossings), and the phase
sequenced BEFORE Phase 7** - the SDF engine rewrites how the sim knows
material, not the order a generator reaches it in, and a gouging entry
is a gouging entry in either engine; the Phase 7 block already warns
its retirement must not ride away the entry-path verdicts, which is the
same argument from the other side.
Considered and dropped: (a) an M6.3 under the UI phase - wrong domain,
and the registry's order questions are not chrome work; (b) fixing just
the two pocket ladders now and reviewing later - the same law is
restated (not re-derived) in finishing3d's tangent plunge, contour's
lead-in Z entry (M1.3's still-open "spiral/helical entries" debt), the
drilling R-plane, and the 5-axis/turning approaches; a visit phase makes
each family state its order in writing where the per-bug fix leaves the
next family unasked; (c) running it after Phase 7 - cutting-order bugs
must not wait on a simulator rewrite, and the review's goldens feed
Phase 7's parity law rather than the other way round.

**Chosen: silent fallbacks become diagnostics during the review** - the
dive-None → plunge path posts a status-line note naming the
substitution (Prime Directive: an honest answer beats a silent
reasonable one), and goldens regenerate only where the order genuinely
changes, family by family, heavy envelope/verify lanes as the referee.

Gate: docs-only commit (ROADMAP Phase 8 block + summary rows); each M8
milestone gates on its own ladder + heavy lane as it executes.

## The box_walls verdict rides its own stated law (heavy-lane honesty)

Found on the way into Phase 8, while confirming the motion heavy lane's
baseline: `finish3d::box_walls_are_pure_structure`, the release-lane
test that says the tangent-ladder finish never touches the box roofs,
has been RED since `9f38881` (M5.2 E). Bisect + measurement: the corner
vertex (9.3125, 9.3125) now registers 0.0272 mm of `gouge_mm` against
the test's own budget law `gate = TOL + cell²/(2R)` ≈ 0.1234 mm - real,
sub-gate, verifier-silent (`verify_finish` empty), identical in debug
and release. M5.2 E replaced the dexel height-field gouge law, which
was BLIND to a graze with no floor under the wall columns (its law
compared part-floor Z to the lowest ball-bottom - a pure wall has no
floor), with exact facet-to-path distance; the facet law sees the corner
the floor law could not. The `assert_eq!(gouge_mm, 0.0)` was stale
scaffolding that only ever held because of the blind spot - the test's
M2.2a comment already named the budget ("under budget, not zero").

**Chosen: the assert becomes `gouge_mm <= gate(cell)`** - the law the
comment states, with a comment on the assert telling the reader why the
zero was legal before and is not now. Considered and dropped: (a)
re-exempting walls in the sim law - that rebuilds the exact blind spot
M5.2 E's envelope generalization exists to close, and "never gouge"
means the strict channel, softened only by the documented deflection
budget; (b) loosening the gate constant - the budget is tool-deflection
physics, not a fudge knob; (c) rewriting the fixture so the corner is
truly untouched - the graze is honest generator output at that tolerance
and geometry, and moving the benchmark to flatter the law inverts the
referee.

**Chosen: the M5.3-E entry carries an erratum** (amended in place below
its own text - see that section): its "no verdict moved" claim was true
of the lanes that ran at that close-out and false of `finish3d`'s
ignored lane, which did not run - this red sat unnoticed across two
milestones. The lane-history gap is a process finding, recorded here:
close-outs were interpreting "release ignored lane" as app+sim only,
while motion's 28 measured tests (27 finish3d + 1 flow) carry verdicts
too. **Chosen: from now
on every milestone close-out runs
`cargo test --release --target-dir target-release -p <crate> -- --ignored`
for every crate touched since the last close-out** - this fix's own
gate ran motion's full ignored lane green (27/27 finish3d + flow) before
commit.

**Chosen: PATH-shadow fix gets a durable note** - this machine's PATH
carries Git's `mingw64\bin` before MSYS2's, and the older DLLs there
break gcc-15's `cc1.exe` (0xC0000139) mid-C-compile, which cargo
reports as a flecs build failure. Release-lane commands prepend
`C:\msys64\mingw64\bin` to PATH; the gate that just ran did not need
the workaround, so it is a standing caution, not a broken thing.

Gate: debug `cargo test -p camcraft-motion --test finish3d` 13/13;
release ignored lane 27/27 finish3d + 1/1 flow, zero FAILED crate-wide;
clippy -p camcraft-motion --all-targets clean; 13 .nc goldens and every
fixture byte-identical (the diff is one assert + comments).

## M6.1 C - the switcher's seams, and a leak the switcher found

Five hours unattended, five decisions. All reversible, all in
`crates/app/src/commands/theme.rs` + `crates/ui/src/state.rs` +
`egui_app/{theme,theme_files,pages,shell}.rs`.

**Chosen: the switcher lives on the setup page, not the top-right corner**
- ROADMAP sketched "top-right"; the ribbon is painted from `painted.rs`
  with coordinate-located cells and test-fixed positions, and M6.2 owns
  its sectioned restructure. Considered and dropped: (a) a ribbon
  dropdown - it would rebuild furniture M6.2 is about to rebuild, and
  the coordinate tests churn twice; (b) a dedicated window - more
  chrome than the choice deserves. `theme_section` in the setup page
  sits beside `machine_section`/`post_section`: same furniture row,
  same law, zero painted-coordinate churn (the gate: no snapshot moved).

**Chosen: the app validates the REFERENCE, the ui validates the PARSE**
- `SetTheme::new` checks a `Named` against BUILTINS and a `File` for
  existence; nothing in app names serde_json (layering: ui -> app ->
  flecs, and app must not know the theme format's parser). The cost is
  two refusal sites - the constructor (name, path) and the shell's
  pre-step (a file that exists but is corrupt refuses before the
  command is even created). Considered and dropped: (a) parsing in app
  behind a trait - ceremony for a call-site the shell already owns;
  (b) letting a corrupt file land and refusing only at draw - it works
  (sync refuses by name, keeps the live ink), but a picker that queues
  doomed commands is worse UX than one that refuses at the click.

**Chosen: the look syncs at the frame edge, once per change**
- `State::sync_theme` runs atop `shell_layout` (the one pass both live
  frames and frame tests share), gated on `ThemeRef` equality - steady
  state costs one clone + one compare, file mtime stats only on change
  edges. Considered and dropped: per-draw resolution (touches the
  parser on every frame - B's whole cache exists to avoid that) and
  applying inside `run_command` (undo/redo would miss it; the sync
  point is where history can drift, so that's where truth is read).
  Refusals keep the live tokens and state themselves once in the
  status - the look never half-changes, the Prime Directive in theme
  clothes.

**Chosen: NewDocument clears ALL singletons - and that found a real leak**
- wiring `theme_set(&world, &ThemeRef::Dark)` into the NewDocument arm
  made the neighbour's bug visible: M3.3 A gave PostRef undo and
  persistence but never reset, so File>New silently kept the previous
  document's user `.cps`. Fixed here (`post_set(... Builtin)`); the
  leak class is stated: every future singleton must land in the same
  arm, and the units law ("absence clears") was the precedent.

**Chosen: discovery anchors CARGO_MANIFEST_DIR, labels come from the cache**
- `theme_dir()` resolves `../../assets/themes` beside the crate, not
  from CWD - snapshot suites run with CWD=crates/ui and everything
  else from the root; one law for both. `peek_label` names discovered
  files from the parse cache only (cached-OK themes), falling back to
  the file stem - listing a folder must never parse it, the browser's
  own law. ComboBox labels are `titled` (first char up) - "dark" reads
  as a word, not a log line.

Gate: full ladder by the gate subagent - app commands_undo 28/28 (the
new theme law test), project_roundtrip 60/60 (v41 round-trips, dark
writes no key, stranger names land as written), posting 16/16 (the 13
.nc goldens byte-identical, default path untouched), ui lib 119/119,
theme_files 10/10, every snapshot binary green with zero golden
churn, headless rc=0 View3D green, clippy -D warnings both crates.

## M6.1 D - derived contrast: the follow law, the readability gate, the light golden

**What the contrast module owns, and why it is its own file.**
`crates/ui/src/egui_app/contrast.rs`: WCAG 2.1 luminance/ratio (public
formula, W3C REC), the readable text-on-fill choice, the follow law, and
the readability gate. Chosen: a new `pub mod contrast` - the arithmetic
is pure colour maths over `Color32`, both consumers (`theme::visuals`,
`theme_files::parse`) plus `painted`'s glyph tint and the golden read
the ONE table, and the file stays well inside the 400-law. Considered
and dropped: folding into `theme.rs` (375 -> ~530 LOC) or
`theme_files.rs` (at the limit, and about parsing - the gate is not a
parse concern). Provenance: the sibling project's
derive-don't-trust-hand-typed-states architecture at the user's
direction; thresholds, the linear-light form and every number ours.

**The law: unspelled states ride the accent, in linear light.**
A file that changes ACCENT and leaves `accent_hover`/`field_active`/
`selection_bg` unspelled gets the base column's own per-channel
linear-light step (`state - accent`) translated onto the new accent,
re-gammas, clamps never wraps, a negative step undershooting black
lands on 0 not NaN. Chosen over: HSL lightness steps (egui has no hsl,
and the built-in hovers are NOT lightness multiples - dark's hover
lifts +8%/-25%/-18.5% per channel; the delta translation reproduces
that, which is the point: hover still lifts, active still sinks toward
the field, whatever accent a file brings); and over requiring files to
spell all four (the ROADMAP asked for states *generated from* the
accent). Identity round-trips byte-exactly on both built-in columns
(six golden asserts), so the law never churns a base. Accepted
consequence, made visible: the translation is not hue-locked -
teal-night's derived `field_active` is #005200 (the base's red-channel
-2.5% floor clamps out of a teal-seeded step). A green-shifted
selected-field is legible as intent (still the base's own distance
from the accent), and every unspelled move prints an honest note in
the theme's status line. Spelling always wins: a spelled state gets no
touch and no note.

**The stroke-rides-hover law.** An unspelled `selection_stroke` becomes
the final `accent_hover`, spelled-or-derived: both built-in columns
already store the stroke AT the hover - the file overlay broke that
coincidence, the law restores it, so the focus line always matches the
button the eye just followed. It notes only when it actually moved;
`teal-night.json` spells a matching value and stays silent.

**The gate, and its two honest exemptions.** `readable()`: text >= 4.5
on all four shell grounds, text_dim >= 4.5 on the two strips,
`selection_stroke` >= 3.0 on the window ground, and
`ratio(on_fill(fill), fill) >= 4.5` on both accent fills. That last
pair can never fail by the formula's shape - the better of white and
black is always >= 4.583:1 - kept written as the law it guards,
checkable should `on_fill` ever grow a third ink. `text_faint` is
exempt: it is disabled-state ink, the one tier WCAG itself excuses
(this also grandfathers LIGHT's faint at 2.93). Refusal lands at
parse - the file's origin, the failing pair and its ratio named in the
status line, the live look never changes (refusal-not-style, the Prime
Directive's theme-case form). Both built-in columns pass their own
table's gate; the golden asserts it - they define what readable means
here.

**The bug the arithmetic found.** `widgets.active.fg_stroke` was
hand-typed `Color32::WHITE` since A: white on the hover/active accent
is 3.83:1 dark / 4.29:1 light - under the AA floor in BOTH built-in
columns, black clears both. Found by computing, not observing: a
momentary pressed-state ink, never in a snapshot. Now
`on_fill(accent_hover)`. DARK frames stay byte-identical everywhere by
construction (hovered stroke resolves to WHITE on dark's steel blue;
the painted glyph's white tint resolves to WHITE, its disabled alpha
rides the same hue - the old `from_white_alpha(115)` pixel identity
proven, and the gate's snapshots confirmed it).

**The light golden.** `egui_shell_snapshot_light` drives the
switcher's own door - the world carries `ThemeRef::Named("light")`,
the frame-edge sync lands the column - so the pixels prove the PATH,
not just the table, paired with `readable()` on the live table
(ROADMAP: "the light theme ships alongside as a second golden set").
The three snapshot tests share a process-wide mutex because
`theme::current()` is ONE live static: without it a parallel dark
frame could catch the light table and fail its own golden. The golden
was generated deliberately once (UPDATE_SNAPSHOTS), eyes-checked
(paper grounds, dark ink, the tree eye visible where hand-typed white
had been invisible), and the dark goldens re-passed unchanged beside
it.

**ColorVision deferred, with the milestone's own word for it.** The
ROADMAP names the protan/deutan/tritan layer "a cheap follow-on once
the token table exists" - the table now exists, and the remap is a
rendering-accessibility feature, not the readability law this stage
guards. Chosen: land D complete, defer the follow-on rather than
expand the stage; its input (the Tokens table + this module's ratio
math) is pub, so it rides an M6.1-E-style slot at near-zero cost.

**M6.1 marked done in the registry.** All seven of the milestone's
bullets are satisfied by A+B+C+D; the only unbuilt thing is the
above's named follow-on, which the milestone text itself puts outside
the list ("once the token table exists"). Precedent read: M5.3 marked
done with road-not-taken items in RECOMMENDED. The Phase-6 release
(0.5.0) still belongs to M6.2's close-out, as the registry note says.

**teal-night.json stays the derivation demonstration** (accent +
geometry, one honest note when selected); a rust-accent file in the
suite demonstrates the full four-note family.

Gate: full ui ladder by the gate subagent - lib 119/119 (incl. the
four new D tests), theme_files 14/14, gpu_render 7/7, app
commands_undo 28/28, project_roundtrip 60/60, both dark snapshots
byte-unchanged (the derivation's dark identity proven by pixels),
clippy -D warnings zero, headless rc=0; then the light golden authored
in-session and re-gated: full lib 120/120, all three snapshot tests
green under the lock, clippy --tests clean.

## M6.2 - the ribbon restructure: the taxonomy's seams, the fold's law, the pin's exemption

**Section is the stored truth, Family the derived one.** `KindInfo` grows a
`section` column (rows 0..4 Milling 2D, 5 Drilling, 6..7 Milling 3D, 8..17
Multi-axis, 18..29 Turning - each a contiguous run of the table, proven by
the partition test), and `family()` becomes a getter: Turning section means
Turn, anything else Mill. Chosen over the symmetric alternative (store
`Family`, derive sections): the ribbon and the combo organize by section,
so the thing the surfaces quote is the thing the table stores, and the old
mill/turn split - a fact about machines, not about menus - cannot drift
from it. `Family::admits` stays the one machine-pairing home;
`operation::shown_for(machine)` is the one hiding filter, and both ribbon
and combo draw from it, so "which sections does this machine run" exists
exactly once. Considered and dropped: a bool `is_turn` on KindInfo (the M3
shape) - two fields, two truths, one test would still be needed to keep
them agreed.

**Hiding, not darkening, and the door is the reach.** The ROADMAP's law
lands verbatim: a lathe document never shows waterline, so the eighteen
mill cells are gone, not dimmed, and the a_lathe test's "darkens" promise
moved to the hiding+door law with it. A dark cell under the new taxonomy
would be a lie - the machine cannot run the kind, and the cell would say
"click me anyway"; the tip keeps the remedy in words (mount a lathe or a
mill-turn), naming the machine's own word from the post crate's
`Kind::word` - one naming home, re-exported, not retyped.

**The fold is width-driven and nothing else.** Cells share the strip
fairly down to a 40px floor; when the fair share drops below it, the
group with the most inline cells loses its tail cell to a door
("{Section}..."), and the loop repeats. Chosen: fold the fattest, tail
first, so every group's INLINE part stays a contiguous table run and the
caption span under it remains honest; a per-group threshold
("Mill3D always folds first because it's 'less used'") was dropped - it
would be a second taxonomy, hand-maintained, contradicting the milestone.
The first fold of a group is width-neutral (N cells out, N-1 plus one door
in), later ones net -1, so the loop terminates - proven, not assumed, by
the hand-math test: the house 1280 ends at 28 cells and every
pre-M6.2 click-through target (Face/Face-mill/Pocket/Drill cells) is
still inline at that width; the four old ribbon tests pass with only the
layout call's signature moved. "..." over a chevron glyph: the door's
label is the section's name + an ellipsis; no glyph, because the ROADMAP
names the label as the thing the door carries, and the asset law keeps
new glyphs original-only - a typographic dot-run needs no asset.

**The pin rides the document, deliberately outside the history.** M6.2 is
the first place ROADMAP lifts "everything is a command": pins are a
`RibbonPins` flecs singleton saved into the project (v42, absent key =
unpinned, `skip_serializing_if` keeps an unpinned document paying nothing
- the mm/units law), toggled by right-click on the cell or a dropdown row.
Undo replaying a pin would replay layout, and the roadmap says cuts, not
layout; the interaction test proves exactly that seam: cut, pin, undo -
the operation is back and the pin stays. Chosen over pin-as-command:
every undo step would carry ribbon noise, and a pinned-then-deleted
machine kind would leave the history inverting a setting the document no
longer wants. Read-side stranger filter, write-side clean (duplicates,
out-of-range dropped keeping order), load LANDS (not merges - the leak
law a stale singleton can never survive an open), and the Pinned group
leads the sections in pin order, never folds, and hides-not-drops a pin
the current machine cannot run: switching a lathe document to a mill must
not quietly forget what the user pinned.

**The dropdown's coordinate law, and the bug that wrote it.** The first
implementation drew the rows in Area-LOCAL rects (0..200 under the
origin) and passed those same rects to `ui.interact` - and the rows never
got a click: this app's panels, and the Area's child ui too, hit-test in
GLOBAL coordinates, so the invisible widget rect sat in the window's top
corner while the panel painted under the button. A press on a row fell
through to the cell BEHIND the dropdown and created the wrong kind,
silently as far as the dropdown was concerned. Found by instrumenting the
click-through, fixed by one rule now written at the call site:
ribbon_cells computes every rect global, and the Area is only the layer.
(The Prime Directive's UI case: a control that looks pressed but answers
a different widget is a silent wrong answer.) Close-on-outside-press is
hand-drawn too, with the frame-order guard: a press that toggled a door
THIS frame (`state.ribbon_more != before`) is the new door's own business
and must not be eaten by the closing test - the click-two-doors fast case
that egui's own popup layer handles but a painted panel must handle
itself. A stale `ribbon_more` (window widened, door folded away)
self-heals at the top of the next frame, so the state can never name a
cell that no longer exists.

**The combo earns the shape, with the selected kind's section exempt.**
Same ORDER, same admits - and one judgment call recorded here: a section
is skipped when the machine cannot run it AND it is not the current
kind's section. Hiding the current type from a document whose kind
disagrees with its (newly swapped) machine would leave the combo naming
its own selection with no row to point at; the kind stays listed where
it is, exactly once, so the mismatch is visible, nameable, fixable - the
retype itself still refuses through the command gate (M3.2 E), so the
surface tells the truth twice rather than hiding the fact once.

**The verbatim-imgui promise retires here, as M6.2's test law said.**
`tips_match_the_imgui_table` asserted imgui's literal string table; the
ribbon's tips now carry the pin suffix and the section-shaped machine
sentence, so the test became what it can honestly be: the anchor cells'
verbatim tips + the format law for every Create cell + every door named
by its section. The strings are ours (clean-room), the shape is the
milestone's.

**Goldens moved deliberately.** The strip gained captions, doors and the
hiding law, so all three shell/tool-editor goldens changed; they were
regenerated once with UPDATE_SNAPSHOTS, eyes-checked (28 cells at 1280,
"Drilling" alone between Milling 3D and Multi-axis on a mill document,
the Turning-only lathe row), and now pin the new shape.

Gate: app lib ribbon 5/5 (the partition, the derived-family law, the
filter table, the pin's read/write clean, v42 byte-shape + v41 step-up);
ui lib 126/126 (six new M6.2 tests: every-kind-a-home on three machines
at two widths, fold-fairness both directions, the dropdown's reach
end-to-end, the pin-survives-undo seam, the Pinned group's lead order and
machine respect, the stale-door heal); shell 19/19, ui operations 31/31,
app operations 101/101, commands_undo 28/28, project_roundtrip 60/60,
stock_sim_document 8/8, setups 11/11; clippy -D warnings clean on both
crates (four hits taken: a doc continuation, the layout tuple's name,
two let-chains).

## M8.1 - The roughing ladders: the order as found, the order as fixed

The visit's verdict, stated per the phase's law (rapid -> approach ->
entry -> cut -> link -> retract). FOUND: rapid over `passes[0]`'s
start - for a Waterline/Adaptive plan that is the OUTERMOST ring, so
the approach aimed at the finished wall; entry - always the axial
plunge at level 0 whatever family was selected (both ladders gated the
arms on a level crossing: `!first &&` in `levels.rs`, `li > 0` in
`ladder.rs`), and at crossings the helix's landing search
(`dive_point`'s longest-chord-midpoint scan) resolved None on every
all-arcs ring plan, so the helix silently degraded to climb-and-dive
there too; cut - wall rings first, core last; link - feed when
`chord_clears` proved containment, which on a holed floor let a chord
cross every planned ring under it (the boss bug the plan test exists
to refuse); retract - to clearance, unchanged. Verdict: WRONG, three
ways - the chosen entry never met the stock, the dive landed on the
wall, and the ring order was backwards for roughing. FIXED order:
rapid to the floor's own dive room (interior, disc-clear), entry by
the stated family at level 0 as well as at crossings, cut
interior-out with the wall pass walking last, link feed only when the
chord is proven against containment AND the level's planned paths,
retract unchanged.

**Chosen: `dive_room` (largest ear-centroid with a boundary-distance
margin) replaces `dive_point`'s chord scan.** The scan's defect is
structural: an all-arcs plan's consecutive pairs sit ON ring lines,
so no midpoint is ever inside the eroded leg region - None - and None
is a substitution the user could not see. A triangle of the region's
own ear-clip is material by construction, and its centroid carries a
measurable clearance, so the same code answers both "where" and "how
much room", with the helix arm asking margin = radius + 1e-3 and the
axial arms 0.0. By the superset law (a deeper center is a subset of
every plane above it) room AT THE DESTINATION is room across the whole
crossed depth - which is what let the `li > 0` / `!first &&` gates
become proofs: level 0 dives from `clearance_z` (`prev_z` falls back
to it), and the arm is honest there because the dive crosses only
air, so the family is obeyed from the first level.
Considered and dropped: (a) a largest-inscribed-circle search (the
medial axis/straight skeleton - exact, but a new geometric engine for
a landing spot; the ear centroid is within a triangle's width of the
true center and the margin test proves what it claims); (b) seeding
the dive on the planned passes themselves (it re-imports the wall:
`passes[0]`'s start is exactly the spot the entry law refuses).
Caveat kept honest: on a hair-thin band no ear centroid reaches
mid-line (the 2/3 rule), so real room can answer None - that is a
SAID substitution (`entry: ... the floor has no dive room either`),
never a silent wrong dive.

**Chosen: erosion by DISTANCE, not by boolean, for the room margin -
`boundary_clears` walks every loop edge and measures point-to-segment
distance.** Found mid-stage, from the 3-D boss-band test failing with
a helix that "landed" inside the wall's own circle: `Region::offset(-d)`
on an annulus NARROWER than `2d` makes the shrunk outer loop fall
inside the grown hole - the boolean's loops cross and the output is a
symmetric-difference ring that is self-consistent under its OWN
`contains` yet material where the truth is empty. A containment-guard
fix was insufficient (the phantom region contains its own phantom
centroids); the distance test cannot lie that way - it measures the
real clearance or says it is not there. The helix arm dropped the
offset leg entirely (no `?` to propagate on that path), and
`dive_room_never_lands_outside_the_region` pins the annulus directly:
a ring with margin beyond half its width answers None, and any Some
is `contains`-true. This is the Prime Directive read at the geometry
seam: a boolean whose failure mode is "wrong but consistent" is not a
law to build a dive on.

**Chosen: roughing waterline runs inside-out by reversing the loop
LISTING (`loops.sort_by_key(Reverse(k))`, stable, so same-ring
families keep their area order) - ring geometry and the chaining laws
untouched.** Chains then seed in the core and walk outward; a chord
between adjacent offsets is the same chord either way, so only the
walking order changed. FINISH waterline (`machining3d::rings`) keeps
wall-first - it is the honest shape there, the phase text says so,
and the file comment points at the split. Stated vacuity: on a floor
whose band is narrower than the stepover the ring family collapses to
k=0 alone and the reversal is a no-op - the wall loop IS the floor's
only loop and diving at its start is not a wall-entry bug (the tool
stands in clearance, never on a finished face it could mar). The
plate-with-island goldens are exactly this shape (2 mm band, 3 mm
stepover): their level-0 first entry is UNCHANGED by M8.1 by law, not
by oversight - `roughing_rings_run_inside_out_and_the_wall_walks_last`
pins the reversal on a multi-ring floor, and the goldens pin that a
single-family floor stays byte-identical at level 0.
Considered and dropped: a continuous inward spiral (link chords would
cross rings at every family transition on holed floors - the chaining
sweep already says those pairs belong in separate passes).

**Chosen: `Adaptive` keeps its name; the label's promise was verified
honest, and trochoidal wall-following is DEFERRED.** The visit's
question - does the strategy deliver the HEM the name suggests? - has
a two-part answer: the motion is rings, not a trochoid, but the
documentation was amended at M5.1 H, not silently kept overpromising:
pocket.rs's variant comment says "Constant-engagement rings", and the
panel states the law under the combo ("rings step by tool_r x
(1 - cos a)"). The engagement claim is true of what it does - each
ring bites the wall by the sagitta-bound angle (M2.1c). A true
trochoid (radial infeed with lateral wall clearance) is a new
generator class; folding it in would re-run the whole engagement
audit, and M8.1's scope is ORDER. Considered and dropped: renaming
the combo entry ("Rings (constant engagement)") - the string is in
UI snapshot goldens and no user-visible promise is broken by
"Adaptive" once the panel says what it does; HEM within this stage -
wrong milestone, right ledger line.

**Chosen: substitutions are said - the notes channel (Toolpath.notes,
PathBuilder::note, status_summary suffix, PathDto.notes as an
additive `#[serde(default)]` key, no PROJECT_VERSION bump).** Every
silent fallback this stage found (blocked ramp chord, disc fits
nowhere, no dive room either) now appends one sentence naming the
why and what it did instead ("entry: the ramp's chord is blocked -
axial dive on the floor instead"), and the status line carries them.
A quiet path renders exactly as it always did - the suffix is absent,
not empty (`notes_ride_the_path_and_the_status_line`). Considered
and dropped: Record::Warn-style diagnostics on the stream (the path's
own notes ride the document, survive project save, and belong to the
path that caused them; a stream warning would be at the wrong
lifetime).

**Chosen: the double-dive at a level change stays when the link chord
is unproven - interior axial dive, hop, traverse, wall dive (+6 moves
per level change in the two island goldens).** `dive_room` lands the
entry in the floor's core; running the link as a feed at depth would
cross planned rings, which `verify`'s Crossing law reports - and that
law is ORDER-agnostic, so "rings already walked, so the chord is
over-cut floor" is not a defense it accepts. The hop is 3 moves nobody
can prove away; it is posted, and the notes say why when it is a
substitution. Goldens re-blessed with the diff reviewed move-by-move:
level transitions only, level 0 byte-identical, all 13 .nc goldens and
the other 18 .cl goldens unchanged (the ordering change is vacuous on
their floors - stated above).

Gate: the honest sequence has two rounds. The first authoritative
round came back RED on two counts the local ladder had missed -
clippy::too_many_arguments on the two new `cen`-widened arms
(ladder.rs:275/:300, eight arguments where the lint wants seven or
fewer), and the re-blessed .cl goldens with stale DERIVED .nc: the .nc
diff is exactly the M8.1 double-dive posting at each level change
(interior axial dive, hop, traverse, wall dive), level 0 byte-identical,
the sinumerik bulk block renumbering. Remediation 6f7fa3f: `LevelCtx`
bundles the level a dive lands on (structure only - the five fields
arrived together at every call site and always will), and
`WRITE_GOLDEN=1 cargo test -p camcraft-app --test conformance` caught
all five dialects up. Second round green: clippy `-D warnings` clean on
motion (the refactor's claim to be behavior-preserving is pinned by
machining2d 54/54 and machining3d 22/22 byte-identical), golden_cl
20/20, conformance 4/4, fanuc_post 8/8; the earlier app full suite
(UI 234/234, release heavy lane) stands - the fix moved no motion.

## M8.1 correction - the level-0 claim was still false, and a probe test is why we know

The green second round above verified counts, not shapes: no test
asked what the FIRST cut level opens with. The
`the_entry_family_is_obeyed_at_the_first_level` probes (this round's
addition) answered: it does not. cc5d89d shipped the family's
crossings and left both level-0 gates in place - `!first` in
`levels.rs`, `li > 0` in `ladder.rs` - so a chosen Helix or Ramp still
opened with a straight wall plunge at level 0, notes empty. The
founding M8.1 defect, wearing the gate's hat: every count in the law
tests (the 5→6, 14→15 updates above) was derived from the dive-at-wall
behavior the ledger claimed replaced.

**Chosen: remove the gates, don't paper them.** Both ladders' entry
match now arms on a move onto fresh material -
`first || last_cut_z != Some(z)` (2-D), `rest.is_none()` (3-D) - with
the `prev_z` fallbacks (`unwrap_or(clearance_z)`,
`map_or(clearance_z, …)`) already honest for the first level.
Considered and dropped: a level-0 special case that dives interior
only when the family is Helix - a second law to maintain, and the
fallbacks make the uniform one sound.

**Chosen: the ramp's legality question moves to the DESTINATION's
center.** `chord_clears(&center, leg, entry)` replaces the previous
level's test: islands only grow downward, so the plane the descent
ENDS in is the tightest corridor - and one test then covers every
plane above it (the superset law). The old prev-center test was sound
only where walls stand vertical; on a tapering model it checked the
widest plane and could gouge the narrowest. Latent, unfixed before
this round; now closed by the same line.

**Chosen (finding, not preference): on the rotary bar, the ramp law
honestly posts SUBSTITUTED dives - and the real bug was the silent
notes channel.** The failing `a_ramp_entry_runs_the_ladder_too`
showed no diagonals and no notes: every chord refuses the
destination's eroded strip (the open band spirals inward with depth,
so the leg-in never lies inside the next level's center), the arms
substitute as specced - and `wrap_exit`, which rebuilds the revolved
path move by move, dropped `base.notes` on the floor. M8.1's notes
channel never visited that leg of the map; a verdict spoken on the
developed plan went silent on the real one. Fixed with the merge into
the finished path (`path.notes.extend(base.notes…)`), and the test
now asserts the law's honest disjunction - descends diagonally OR
says "ramp's chord is blocked" - plus the radial substituted dive.
Considered and dropped: forcing the rotary to descend by arc instead
- the wrap's ramp angle law is the finish3d's business, not the
offset pocket's, and inventing it here would be M8.2 work smuggled
into a correction.

**Golden consequence (amends the "level 0 byte-identical" claims
above - true of cc5d89d's gated code, never of the law it stated):**
the two island-pocket fixtures' FIRST entries move by the same +3
head as their level changes (interior dive, hop, wall dive), .cl
58→61 and 138→141, the other 18 .cl byte-identical - the only two
islandless-pocket goldens that exist, do not: the rest of the set is
contour/slot/trace (no center passed to `run_levels` - the family
reaches none of their entries by design), drill/face/tap, and the
finish3d family (its own law, M8.2's visit). The two root + four dialect .nc catch up with
their fixtures (sinumerik renumbers). App `operations` (101) and the
UI suite (234) unchanged. `clippy::filter_next` on a test's
`filter().next_back()` became `rfind` - mechanical.

Decisions taken unattended: new pin tests count (55/23); the disjunctive
shape of the rotary assert (a law test that only fits today's geometry
rots); the ledger's correction style (this section adds, no prior text
rewritten).

## M8.2 A - contour's entry family: what certifies a descent in an already-open bore

The contour op dove straight down at its start on every level — the
one family of generators Phase 8 found with no entry law at all.

**Chosen: `Side::Inside` is the air that certifies the descent.** A
bounded inside orbit circles a hole that already exists: the column
above the bore floor is empty, so what the dive needs is room to
LAND — `dive_room`'s erosion-by-distance verdict on the destination
level — not the roughing overlap law (which proves room along a
swept corridor metal was removed from). Same helpers as the ladders,
different warrant, stated in the law comment. Considered and
dropped: reusing the roughing `chord_clears` corridor test — it would
refuse every legal bore entry, there is no corridor to prove.

**Chosen: wall-side opt-in is refused BY NOTE, grazing kept.** An
outside contour's descent has no bounded air; posting the family's
helix there would cut up through the finished wall. The op still
runs (the graze arc is the wall's own tangent law) and says so in
`Toolpath.notes` — a substitution verdict, never silence.
Considered and dropped: hard refusal — an existing document must
keep generating; the verdict channel is what the Prime Directive
asks for.

**Chosen: validation is positivity-only on `helix_radius`** (not
machining3d's `<= -tool_radius` overlap door): the contour orbit
fits by certification per level, and a wrong sign is a bad number,
not a law violation.

**Chosen: the wire ride stays additive.** `project/params.rs` DTO
gains the entry fields under `serde(default)` — PROJECT_VERSION
untouched, every older project still loads and its contours inherit
Plunge (today's behavior: the plain dive). The digest carries the
entry as one byte so an edit marks the contour stale and re-runs
generation (`an_entry_edit_marks_the_contour_stale_and_the_wall_
regen_moves_nothing` pins both halves).

**Chosen (housekeeping): a Phase 1–2 archive of the Done-ledger was
reverted before commit.** The ROADMAP-splitting agent, after landing
5e61bed (Phases 3–6, all ✅ — legal), continued into Phases 1–2. The
foot registry says otherwise: M2.4/M2.5 read 📋 and the M2.5
families (pencil, geodesic, morphed spiral, steep-and-shallow,
deburr) exist nowhere in the code — the ⚠️ rows too: M1.3's
spiral/helical entry debt is this very phase's open work. The move
rides the table's verdict, not memory; the prose stays in ROADMAP.md
until those rows go green.

Decisions taken unattended: the entry combo rides SEC_LEADS beside
the existing lead settings (one section owns approach-and-entry
words); `contour_along_chain` exported for the open-run entry
(entry law speaks on chained runs first — open runs take the family
in M8.2's next stage); the ~20 ContourParams literal updates made
explicit rather than a Default impl (every call site states the
entry it wants).

## M6.2 rebuild - the ribbon remake: the fold made structural, the pin budget, the machine door

The user's hand-test verdict on the M6.2 ribbon: still too crowded, and
no visible way to move between Milling / Turning / Mill-turning. The
width-driven fold was the flaw: at every plausible window size most
sections unfolded side by side and their tails showed as loose cells -
a crowd that only folds when squeezed is still a crowd. Chosen: the
structural fold - at ANY width, the bar shows the user's pins (budget:
`MAX_PINS = 4`, the pins list truncated by `take()`, surplus stay listed
behind their section doors so nothing becomes unreachable) and every
family lives behind exactly one labeled door. Dropped: keeping the
40px-floor squeeze loop (a layout heuristic for a taxonomy problem),
and per-family unfolded tails (two truths about where a kind lives -
the door and the row at once).

**Chosen: a pin leaves its section's door list.** One home per kind on
the bar - the pin IS its front placement; double-homing (pin cell plus
door row) would let one click mean two things. Pins stay a document
setting outside the history (M6.2's original law, untouched): undo
replays cuts, not layout.

**Chosen: the workspace switch rides the undo history as a command.**
The machine door (Setup group, caption reads `machine::kind_of`) picks
among MACHINE_MODES, and each row pushes `LoadBuiltinMachine` - the
same front-door law the CLI path already honored; no bare field poke,
so Ctrl+Z restores the previous machine and, with it, the families the
ribbon shows. Dropped: a mode enum of its own (second truth about what
machine runs - the mounted machine IS the mode) and darkening rows
that are current (guard returns early; the row says "(current)").

**Chosen: the door's mutual exclusion is immediate-mode state.**
`ribbon_more` / `ribbon_mode_open` - one door open at a time (Paths
law); the machine door shares the close-on-second-click law. No new
glyphs (the no-new-asset promise holds): the machine door wears its
Title-case word.

**Chosen (gate hygiene): three pixel goldens regenerated in this
commit's lane.** The ribbon's shape IS the change; the snapshots
record it deliberately, per M6.2's test law about moving the tables
with the shape on purpose.

## M8.2 B - the ramped first contact: a flag, a normal, and refusals that speak

**Chosen: `Finish3DParams::entry_ramp` is opt-in, default `false`, and
`false` means v0.4's path byte for byte.** The re-proof (B1) showed the
vertical plunge already never cuts above its ring - even on a 60° cone -
so nothing was broken and a fix must not move anyone's goldens. The
13 `.nc` goldens and the `.cl` dumps are byte-identical at the gate,
verified by `git diff` on the golden dir. Considered and dropped:
ramp-by-default (rewrites every waterline golden for a cosmetic entry
change the law never forbade).

**Chosen: the ramp stands one tool-radius out along the contact
normal, and the normal is measured, not assumed.** The diagonal starts
at `c + r·n̂` where `n̂` is the unit vector from the nearest facet point
to the tangent center - the classic lead-in-equals-tool-radius, voiced
for a ball on a faceted surface. `n.z ≤ 0.25` refuses (a near-horizontal
or downward normal would make the entry a lateral in-feed at depth,
which is not an entry motion at all); `tilt < SPLIT_MZ` skips silently
- on gentle tangents the vertical plunge is the honest move and a note
there would be noise. Every refusal writes a `Toolpath.notes` line
naming the z and the reason; the vertical entry then stands unchanged.
Dropped: ramping toward a fixed -45° vector (the "ramp_angle" the
between-family law uses) - at a tangent entry the surface's own normal,
not a user angle, is what keeps the ball out of the wall.

**Chosen: certification samples the two legs (vertical column +
diagonal) against `dist(center, facet) > r - tolerance`.** Same currency
as B1's law probe - tessellation chord-sag (≈3e-4 mm at this fixture's
96 lon) dwarfs any epsilon, so `tolerance` is the honest budget, and
the ring walk's own promise is the budget the ramp must not beat. The
test (`the_ramp_enters_a_steep_ring_on_its_contact_normal`) samples
each diagonal at 9 points and lifts the center straight up from the
entry end, so the ramp is measured, not asserted, and
`diagonals == columns` proves every diagonal rode its certified column.

**Chosen: the digest stamps `entry_ramp`; the DTO field is
`#[serde(default)]` with no PROJECT_VERSION bump.** The flag rewrites
every ring's entry legs, so it rewrites the path - the staleness law
(M4.4) says a move-changing word stamps the digest, and `operations.rs
::the_ramp_flag_stamps_the_digest_and_clears_on_undo` proves the round
trip (edit → Stale, regen → Ok, undo ×2 → byte-identical to the
pre-edit path). Absent in a pre-v0.5 file reads `false` = the old
behavior, exactly like `ramp` rides its DTO.

**Chosen (gate hygiene): the UI checkbox lives in the Ramping group's
neighborhood but reads as its own law.** "Ramp ring entries" sits under
the ring parameters with a one-line tooltip stating the refusal law -
it is not the `ramp` between-family flag and the label must not blur
them; `pages.rs` destructures the variant so a new field can never be
silently invisible to the panel again.

**Disclosure (gate bookkeeping): the M8.2 B gate ran in two rounds.**
The first subagent report carried two failures that were artifacts of
its build snapshotting mid-edit source (the digest test and the cone
law test against a binary compiled between edits); every named check
was re-run serially after the last edit - `operations.rs` twice green,
the finish3d suite green, clippy clean on all three crates with
`--all-targets`, goldens byte-verified - and THAT is what commit
bda85c1 carries. Same tree, calmer order: the report you can trust is
the one that matches the commit's parentage.

## M8.2 C - the slot's stadium, the tab's blind spot: certifying descents where the air lies

The planar family's turn: the slot dove at its starter end on every
level like the contour used to, and Phase 8's visit found a worse one -
the contour's M8.2 A arms certified against FULL-DEPTH floor air, which
on a tabbed level is a lie: a standing tab is material inside that air.

**Chosen: `Cert` - a closed-form convex stadium is the slot's
certification, not the tessellated one.** A slot's legal-center area is
the axis segment's stadium, and the row law stands legitimate cutter
centers EXACTLY on its boundary: rows at |d| = h, cap-arc endpoints at
q² + d² = h². An inscribed 512-chord polygon sits ~1.9e-5·h inside the
true arcs (1.3e-4 mm at h = 7; ~0.019 mm at h = 1000), so the polygon
endpoint test refused the path's own endpoints - the ramp substituted
into a dive on every level of a plain straight slot. A stadium is
convex: endpoints within h of the axis ⟹ the whole chord is inside,
EXACT, no tessellation in sight. The polygon rides along for
`dive_room` only - triangle centroids are strictly interior points,
where an inscribed region can refuse an orbit the true stadium allows
(sub-micron, honest) but can never bless a gouge. Considered and
dropped: a blanket epsilon on `chord_clears` (h·1e-5 + 1e-4 tried
first) - wrong at scale: 0.1 mm of blessed gouge on a meter slot,
and `chord_clears` was never the faulty predicate; the endpoint
containment against the inscribed boundary was.

**Chosen: the tabbed level stands the arms DOWN; the byte shape is
M8.2 A's parent's.** `tabbed = tab_count > 0 && z < bottom_z +
tab_height`: there, the inside-side entry posts exactly the pre-A
shape (`git show 95d50b3^`: rapid across at the current z, axial
plunge at the lead-in) and says why once per generation - "no arm
stands where a tab is material no certification can see". Considered
and dropped: re-certifying against a tab-aware region - the family's
currency is floor AIR (an erosion of the cutter-center area); tabs
are columns of standing METAL at named XY spots, a different shape
no `Region` of this pipeline carries. The certification the arms
would read does not exist at this level; pretending otherwise is the
gouge. The law reads the level, not the knob: a chosen Helix still
helixes on every tab-free level of the same op.

**Chosen: the tall tab raises the hop, provably for free.** On a
tabbed level `hop_z = max(retract, bottom_z + tab_height)`: between
tabs the hop travels over floor already swept and air everywhere
else, but a tab standing ABOVE the hop plane turns the between-pass
rapid into a line through solid. For every file where tabs sit under
the retract plane (all of them, sanely) the clamp is a no-op - it
bites exactly in the self-inflicted case. `contour_hop_rides_the_tall_tab_top`
measures both halves: tab_height 12 puts a rapid at z 6, tab_height 2
puts none.

**Chosen: the trace's verdict is a theorem, not a TODO.** A zero-width
kerf has no area to stand a descent in: no region to erode, no chord
to clear, so plunge is the ONLY legal entry, and no knob changes that
without new proofs. Documented in `slots.rs` where the family's
comments live; trace stays with the ladder's climb-and-dive, honest
and silent because nothing was substituted.

**Chosen: full-width slot says its substitution out loud.** h ≤ 0
(tool width spans the slot) admits no arm; the center is `None`, the
old wall dive runs byte-identical, and ONE note names it - "the
channel has no room the descent could stand in". `Plunge` never even
builds the tessellation: the default path skips the geometry entirely
(no allocation, no sagitta, nothing to certify - the wall dive needs
no warrant because the whole column above is what a plunge is for).

**Chosen: wire and digest ride exactly the contour's M8.2 A pattern.**
`entry` + `helix_radius` (default 1.0) on `SlotParams`,
`#[serde(default)]` on the DTO, no PROJECT_VERSION bump; the digest
stamps both (edit → Stale → regen → different path, and undo ×2
restores the bytes - `operations.rs::an_entry_edit_marks_the_slot_
stale_and_the_orbit_proves_itself`). A slot without `entry` keys
loads as `plunge` + 1.0 (`slot_entry_family_is_a_step_up_on_the_
wire`); `"spiral"` is Corrupt, not a typo honored - three words is
the family's vocabulary.

**Disclosure (gate bookkeeping): the default path moved no bytes.**
No committed golden is tabbed (every fixture tab_count: 0), the slot
default is Plunge (no tessellation built, wall dive unchanged), and
the contour deferral only fires on tabbed levels. All law tests green
at the commit's parent: motion machining2d 65/65 (5 new), app lib 27,
operations 31, project_roundtrip 62, golden_cl 20, ui lib 128,
shell 19, egui_app 3, clippy clean on all three crates. Code commit
6d2c424.

## M8.2 close-out - the heavy lane's verdict, and the roadmap queue beyond Phase 8

**Chosen: M8.2 goes ✅ on the release `--ignored` lane run at the
committed tree (6d2c424), not at the working tree.** app: 3 passed /
0 failed (the 10M-facet stream wall, both envelope verdicts); motion:
28 passed / 0 failed (finish3d 27 including the scallop diagonal
crossing, dome flow); sim and ui have no ignored tests — their slow
suites are the non-ignored snapshot/gpu ones, and the absence is
recorded, not papered over. `git status --short crates` clean after
the run: no committed golden was rewritten. The root `tests/` dir's
`.new.png` candidates predate the lane (known CWD artifact of UI
snapshot suites run outside `crates/ui`) — untracked, unstaged, no
committed golden involved.

**Chosen: the queue order after Phase 8 is M9.1 → M2.4 → M7.1-7.3 →
M2.5.** Considered: numeric order (M2.4 before the UI remake) —
dropped, because M2.4 births seven new kinds and M9.1's law is that
every kind owns its pane: building kinds into the one-dropdown page
would mean touching that page seven more times to tear it apart
afterward. M2.5 waits for M7.1 because its two hardest families
(pencil = the distance field's ridge; steep-and-shallow = the
normal-z split over the field) are field-native — the inside-out
lesson again: build on the representation the family's definition
lives in. M2.4's G41/G42 output ride-along (M1.3's last ⚠️ word)
lands with it: the comp data enters the stream where the generators
enter, not in a retrofit. The registry's remaining ⚠️ rows (M1.1
IGES, M1.4/M1.5's deferred items) get a verdict pass at M7.3's
all-green sweep, where every row must read green or say why not.

## M8.3 drilling - the bore's fit door, the fold's flag, and where a refusal belongs

The drilling family's order-of-operations visit: the R-plane law read
satisfied for every cycle kind (hop `.max(r_z)`, chains starting at
r_z, G73's `.min(p.r_z)` hop), the radial frame clean (mouth-based
already, Tap/Bore/BackBore refused by name at cross.rs), and three
REAL findings, all fixed in the generator, all byte-identical on the
goldens.

**Chosen: the tool-fit refusal lives in `cycle.rs`, not in the command
layer or the verifier.** A slide whose cutting diameter will not enter
the hole is refused where the cycle resolves `kind` - the one place
that holds tool, hole, and cycle simultaneously. Considered and
dropped: a command-construction door (validation-time has no mesh -
recognition's folds land after the command is accepted, so the door
would guard only hand-entered holes); a verifier-only fix (it exists
today, post-hoc and generic - a gouge warning after the toolpath is
built; the Prime Directive's "validate early" wants the named refusal
at the generator, with the verifier kept as the backstop it always
was). The family's own precedent is the tap-feed law: doors that read
generated context live in `cycle.rs`.

**Chosen: one FIT_TOL (0.02 mm) wearing three laws, over a tight 1e-3
door band.** First cut at the door used 1e-3 (ten lattice steps).
Wrong: a RECOGNIZED radius carries the circle fit's own uncertainty -
legitimately ~0.02 - so a snug tool on a real hole would trip a door
stricter than the measurement it gates (a false refusal of a correctly
sized reamer). 0.02 is the same physical quantity in all three places:
the vertex residual a cylinder must meet (`recognize.rs`'s old private
const, value unchanged there), the radius gap that makes a folded wall
pair a real step rather than the same wall twice, and the door's band.
Past the band the refusal is certain; inside it the verifier still
watches with its 0.01 gouge tolerance, so a truly oversize slide is
flagged late-and-generically rather than silently passed - the band
gives the doubt to geometry, never to the wrong tool.

**Chosen: Tap gets no fit door - by fixture, not by oversight.**
`tap_plate` threads a Ø10 tap into a Ø5 pilot: a Tap wider than its
hole is the entire process. Same proof reads why the door matches
only `Bore | BackBore`: the boring slide travels its WHOLE diameter
inside the wall; a drill and a tap are sized to the hole they make,
not the hole they enter.

**Chosen: the counterbore fold says `stepped`, the bore declines, and
per-step cycle emission is deferred.** Recognition's merge_z keeps the
narrow wall and drops the wide ring - a fact no single-radius record
could show, and a Bore cycle finishing "the hole" would silently miss
it. `Hole::stepped` rides the DTO as `#[serde(default)]` (old files
read false - the honest pre-M8.3 truth, no PROJECT_VERSION bump) and
the Drill digest (a re-detect that folds a step marks the op Stale).
`CrossHole` gains no flag: radial Bore is refused by name in v1, so a
flag there would guard nothing. Considered and dropped: emitting the
folded counterbore as a drill-then-bore pair (or G86+step cycles) -
the ring's diameter and depth are exactly what the fold THREW AWAY;
faithful cycles need the wide wall remembered, which is a recognition
feature (ROADMAP-scale), not a cycle law. The door refuses by name
until then: "that hole is a counterbore - the cycle would bore the
narrow dia. through and miss the ring."

**Chosen: Spot hangs its dimple off the mouth, not the R plane.**
SPOT_DEPTH's doc always said "below the entry plane"; the axial law
had drifted to `r_z - SPOT_DEPTH`, so a hole on a pocket floor got an
air cut above the floor instead of its locating dimple. One line
(`(h.entry_z - SPOT_DEPTH).max(h.floor_z)`), harmonizing with the
radial frame, which already read the mouth. Byte-identical whenever
Top-of-Part == the hole's entry, which is every fixture.

**Disclosure (gate bookkeeping): zero golden movement.** All 13 .nc
goldens byte-identical at this commit; every fixture has
`entry_z == r_z` and drills at Auto (never Bore), so all three laws
are no-ops on committed output. Motion lib, drilling_cross, golden_cl,
operations, posting, sim, project_roundtrip, commands_undo, ui suites
green; clippy -D warnings clean on motion/app/ui. Code commit 604adf4.

**Verdict on the visit's open question ("a bored one may" want a
helix): no helix joins the canned bore, and the fit door is what the
question was really asking.** A slide's whole body travels inside the
wall - the only lateral motion it could make IS the cut, so a helical
bore entry would be a single-point tool orbiting, which is a milling
strategy (contour/Helix on a hole region), not a cycle verb. What a
too-wide slide genuinely needs is not a wider door but the honest
answer: it does not fit - refuse by name (the door), or orbit it in
the operation layer with the finishing family's proofs. The catalog
rows already offer that path; the cycle declines it.

## M8.3 multi-axis - the dive's three entry answers, and which one to believe

The posed family's visit asked what the dive's first engagement
really is, what the cone dodge leaves standing at entry, and how
lead/lag answers the dive. The audit answered all three; one law was
wrong, two are verdicts, one is a wording correction.

**Chosen (and fixed): a dive's lead rides the CUT it lands into, not
the plunge.** `pose_law` had the sentence right and the predicate
wrong: "a vertical entry has none of its own, so the next move's
states where the cut goes" fired only on ZERO-travel moves. A dive
dead down onto a flank has travel - all of it down - so the lead
rotation leaned inside the (normal, vertical) plunge plane. The
drive-curve family already solves the same station question the
other way (`curve.rs`: neighbor-tangent through the entry, posed
explicitly onto the first dive), and `wrap_exit` gives a third,
deliberate answer on the azimuth. Fix: exactly-vertical travel
meeting an off-vertical contact asks the next move for the feed
(`stamp.rs`, one `||` in the predicate); a ramped dive keeps its own
vector (it IS a cut direction), and a dive that lands where the path
ends keeps today's "nowhere to lead, hold the normal" tail. Considered
and dropped: harmonizing all three families' entry frames - curve's
tangent-from-neighbors and wrap's azimuth are correct FOR their
motion; the stamp's was the only one contradicting its own comment.
Byte-identical at lead = lag = 0 (the rotation is the identity),
which is every committed golden: the lead-15 flow fixture passes
unchanged, and `the_stamp_leans_a_dive_with_the_cut_it_lands_into`
fails the old law on its z clause. Code commit a006f13.

**Chosen: the escape cone's endpoint-only station stays; the dive's
swept column is the verifier's named, blocking verdict.** Generation
tests the shank at `mv.to` alone (`stamp.rs:164`, `avoid.rs:79-86`):
a pose clear at the endpoint can sweep steel mid-dive, and the
generator gets no dodge chance for it. What catches it is loud and
specific: (c3)'s mid-path sweep (`sweep.rs`, the 4x5 grid between
threaded from/to poses, cut moves) warns by move index, and a warned
path blocks the post (`posting.rs:194`). Considered and dropped:
2-4 lerped `shank_hits` stations inside `cut_axis` - it would
duplicate (c3)'s grid in the generator, change bytes for paths the
post already refuses honestly, and re-implement badly what M7.1's
stock-as-field will do exactly (one SDF lookup per sampled station,
no tessellated column). The verdict line states the division: the
generator aims, the verifier sweeps, the post blocks.

**Chosen: the wrap families' radial-entry assumption is recorded,
not papered over.** `rotary_offset` certifies in developed space and
`wrap_exit` maps a developed plunge through as "the single radial
line it is" with no facets in hand - below rho_max, a radial dive is
ASSUMED free, the s-metric stands at rho_max scale, and neither
rotary twin takes a shank (`params.rs:468-477` says so by exclusion).
A small-radius boss under a dive's azimuth is the hole; the world-
space (c)/(c3)/gouge laws are the backstop that names it at post.
Considered and dropped for this milestone: threading `facets` into
`wrap_exit` and post-mapping each dive - a real feature (world re-
certification of developed paths), it wants M7.1's field to be cheap,
and building it tessellated now would be the third swept-volume
implementation in the tree. The registry verdict line says "assumed
free below the skin's widest radius" in exactly those words.

**Verdict (no fix): the ladder's air links re-pose before every
lateral rapid.** Hops are Feed-up-then-Rapid (`rings.rs:247`,
`march.rs:309`): the air-ending Feed states no pose = vertical, so
the traverse that follows runs straight up the machine's home axis.
verify reads rapids as HELD pose (`sim.rs:584`) and law (d) position-
checks lateral travel under stock, but (c)'s band walk skips rapids
by filter (`engine.rs:115,194`) - the exposure a tilt-POSED rapid
would open is real in law text and unreachable in every shipped
generator's choreography. The verdict line keeps it visible for the
day a generator does link face-first.

**ROADMAP wording correction coming with the close-out annotation:**
the dive is AT the posed axis (orientation is the endpoint's, carried
from the move's first line; positions ride straight down), not ALONG
it - "along" reads as a radial approach, which is the wrap family's
law, not the ladder's.

## M8.3 turning - the order the catalog already promises, and where a lathe's laws stand down

The revolved family's visit asked the inside-out law (M5.2 F) re-asked
as an ORDER question: does every turning generator compute the part
profile BEFORE it sequences its operations, and do the mill-shaped
verifier laws read a lathe honestly? Verdict: yes and yes - the
family was clean; the audit's finding is the record of where each law
stands and why, not a fix.

**Chosen: the catalog row stays the order's home, not a new UI field.**
"rough OD -> face -> drill/bore -> finish, per op, stated in the
catalog rows" is what M8.3 asked; the rows (ROADMAP's Turning section)
carry ✅ homes, the generators sequence per-op from the computed
profile, and `KindInfo` (kinds.rs:1154) deliberately holds no "runs
after:" slot - a tooltip order clause would be a second truth beside
the generators' own choreography. The registry row's verdict text is
this family's statement.

**Chosen (confirmed, not changed): the mill's rapids law stands down
for the lathe, with its reasons in the law text.** Verify's law (d)
skips `Mode::Revolve | Mode::Radial` (engine.rs:383-398): a turning
insert is a POINT in XY and its form lives in the meridian - the XY
column convicts every full-depth threading retract for a collision
the meridian scan knows cannot happen. Fixture steel (d2) still
stands, "it is a box". The turning rapids' safety promise is the
kernel's own and structural: blade.rs travels rapids at
`rho_clear = r_max + tol` (blade.rs:22,148) - every rapid, every
family; there is no parting rapid through X0.0 to collide with, and
the threading pull-out slides along its own kerf's flanks. Law (c)'s
band walk skips rapids in ALL modes (engine.rs:115,194) - the posed
families' hop law re-poses to vertical on the air-ending retract
BEFORE any lateral rapid (stamp.rs's held rule), so no shipped
generator traverses under load with a tilt, and the (c3) mid-path
sweep covers what remains. Considered and dropped: a meridian rapids
law - the promise is by-construction; a law checking a construction
is documentation with a false-positive budget.

**Chosen (confirmed): no turning family can leave a standing step the
next one silently rides through.** Profile roughing refuses
`stepdown > 2 * nose_radius` BY NAME (prof.rs:195, the standing-ridge
law) and steps its ladder down to a uniform `stock_to_leave` that the
finisher's ride at d = nose takes off; facing is a radial-pass ladder
through the axis, station by station (mod.rs stage-A law); boring
enters only through a pre-existing hole or bored pilot - the M5.2 F
door law is the entry, measured as the hole, and the Radial mode's
stands-downs read from exactly that promise. The meridian verdict
(revolve.rs) unions feed bands only - "a rapids' band moves air, not
edges" - because rapids cannot cut, and the scan measures the part,
not the machine's transit.

**Verdict on the `warnings` channel: closed loop, named consumers.**
Generators push (blade/thread/form_warnings, generate.rs:1894-1936),
the cache carries (schema.rs:174), the project persists
(entity.rs:245), the post gate BLOCKS on them (posting.rs:194), the
operation page walls them (pages.rs:352-372) and the tree counts them
(panes.rs:1361) - nothing writes a warning that no one reads, and
nothing reads one that no generator stands behind. Recorded so a
future audit spends its minutes elsewhere.

## M9.1 A - the operation page opens on its own terms: no type dropdown, retype rides the row

The workpane remake's first stage took the Blender hand-test verdict
("not all the functionality is visible") at its root: the kind of an
operation is a CREATION decision, but the page kept exposing it as a
live Type combo - a field that promises an edit and then refuses one.
The dropdown and the "new operation" draft form it served are gone.

**Chosen: the empty state, not a pre-filled form.** With no target and
no selection the operation page now says what is true (pick or create),
instead of pricing a ghost draft the user must first un-type. Creation
rides the ribbon's Create cells and the tree's doors, each naming the
operation after its kind - so the form's old job (a blank with a name
and a type to pick) is gone with it. Considered and dropped: keeping
the form for keyboard-only flows - it needs no dropdown to do that, one
menu press per kind covers it, and the pane stays one truth.

**Chosen: retype is the browser row's context menu, and it is a
command.** Right-click an operation row and the kind list opens
grouped by the ribbon's own section order (Section::ORDER), kinds the
machine's family cannot run listed dimmed - and a dimmed row still
QUEUES its command, because the refusal belongs to the door
(`ChangeOperationKind::new`: family_gate -> is_sane -> depth_sane ->
side_sane) and that door already speaks in one voice for every surface.
Marking the rows dead at the menu would fork the law. The undo unit is
the whole retype: numbers ride `operation::retype_params`, the shared
carry, exactly what quick-add seeds with - the old panes::retype
wrapper retired so the ribbon, the seed, and the menu share one path
and cannot disagree. The menu follows the popup house style (hand-drawn
Area, Foreground, self-heal, outside-press close), not egui's
Popup::context_menu - the app draws its menus one way.
Considered and dropped: a "Change Type" menu item on the row (one more
click, and the row already knows its kinds belong to a list).

**Chosen: kind-previewed names quote the label verbatim, spaces and
all.** Quick-add names "2D Pocket2", the same string the ribbon cell
and the retype row show - a name that silently strips ("2DPocket2")
would be a second spelling of the kind in the document. Entity names
legally carry spaces; the tree row already renders the label. The
number runs past TAKEN names (fill-the-hole), the old form's law
moved with the numbering, not the count, into the unit tests.

**Chosen: first launch starts the operation draft blank.** It is now
only ever a mirror of a real operation (`sync_ops_ui` mirrors or holds,
never invents); at startup there is nothing to mirror. The tool pane's
named drafts are untouched - they are creation forms, and creation
there never was the questionable half. The refusal text for a
parameter edit that smuggles a kind change now names the retype menu,
keeping "the refusal tells you the door" honest.

## M9.1 B - the tab bar folds into one pane (2026-11-02, stage B)

**Chosen: the stacked pane - every section the kind has, one under the
next, under `ui.strong` headers, no clicks.** ROADMAP's "one pane per
operation kind, click-through, no type dropdown" reads the stack as the
goal, and the tab bar was only ever a paging device for it. What the
bar cost: two frames per field change, invisible fields (the Blender
verdict's exact complaint), and a dead-tab class of bug the drift guard
policed by asserting which tab each label sat on. Considered and
dropped: collapsible `CollapsingHeader`s (a fold is a click that hides
state again - the pane is supposed to show the whole truth of the
operation in one scroll, folds included); and restructuring params_fields's
82 `if tab == SEC_*` guards into a placement TABLE (a second source of
truth for where fields live - the guards ARE the placement law, proven
exact this round: a Python brace-walk of all 82 blocks found zero
ungated renders and no arm revisiting a section, so asking each kind's
sections once, in SECTIONS order, reproduces every tab's content
exactly, in the same within-section order).

**Chosen: `op_tab` retires entirely rather than becoming a scroll
anchor.** It was ephemeral view state (never a command, never saved -
the M1.4 toggle law), so its removal costs no history and no file. The
page's own ScrollArea keeps the whole field set reachable; a remembered
fold position would be new state with no law behind it. The tab-click
law test (`tab_click_navigates_and_queues_nothing`) dies with the
field, replaced by `the_stacked_pane_shows_every_section_unasked` -
the same "navigation queues nothing" proof, stated as "there is no
navigation, and the frame still queues nothing".

**Chosen: the drift guard keeps its exact-strength law, restated.**
"visible iff its tab is open" becomes "renders EXACTLY ONCE in the one
frame" (`query_all_by_label(...).count() == 1` per table label) plus
"header present iff the kind has fields for the section" - the
no-dead-tabs law survives as a no-dead-headers law. One field of the
old suite depended on the tab hiding the pane's other numbers
(`drag_and_type_edit_the_same_staged_number`'s "first SpinButton is
Stock to leave"): the stacked pane shows every number, so the locator
moved from tree-order luck to geometry - the DragValue on the field
label's row, scrolled into view first (the scroll is what the tab
click used to buy). Three shell/tool goldens re-blessed: the pixels
moved where the tab bar row used to be; field rows themselves are
layout-identical.

## M9.1 C - the pane law walks the whole registry (2026-11-02, stage C)

- Registry-wide test over the stacked pane, chosen over per-family
  hand-written tables, because the 8-kind drift table covers 8 of 30
  kinds and the two laws the new panes rest on are universal: every
  group header appears exactly once when (and only when) `has_section`
  says the kind has that group's fields, and `params_fields` never
  renders a group twice (one call per section per frame - the
  brace-walk proof made a table by hand). `every_registry_kind_gets_
  its_stacked_pane` loops `KindInfo::ALL`, retype->draft->run, and
  checks header presence against the same `has_section` the pane's
  loop consumes - the law and the render share one predicate, so they
  cannot drift silently. "Part" rides no row: it is not in the
  registry, it is created by the setup lifecycle and its Machine
  group is pinned by M5.2 G's turning tests.
- The first run caught a real production collision: swarf_editor drew
  `field(ui, "Passes")` - in the old tab UI a field reading exactly
  like the other tab's name was harmless, but the stacked pane puts
  the field under its OWN "Passes" header, an echo. Renamed "Pass
  count" (the ladder's rung count; clamped at the draft, so the name
  carries no new law) rather than exempting the label in the test:
  the header-vocabulary collision is the kind of ambiguity the M9.1
  restructure exists to remove. `query_by_label` panics on two
  matches - the test asserts with `query_all_by_label(...).next()`,
  multiplicity-safe, so one collision reports instead of aborting.
- Provenance review of the pane map (close-out bullet): the six group
  names are generic machining vocabulary, every field label and help
  text is ours from the generators' own parameters, the glyph set is
  the Tabler MIT bundle already listed in assets/ui/LICENSES.md, and
  no HSMWorks material (text, icons, posts) was consulted in the
  restructure - it was specced from the user's Blender reference and
  our own KindInfo registry.

## M2.4 A - the two roughing names: full twins, mid-run rows, no new goldens (2026-11-02, stage A)

- Two new OpParams variants (Adaptive2D, Offset2D), each the Pocket's
  field list minus the fields its pinned strategy makes unreachable,
  chosen over a Pocket variant with a kind-alias flag, because the
  registry law every milestone since M5.0.2 enforces is one variant
  per catalog name: the pane, the digest, the sane-gate and the
  project file are exhaustive matches on the enum, and an alias would
  make all four lie about which kind the document holds. Considered
  and dropped: one `Rough2D { strategy }` twin-carrying variant -
  it hides a catalog name inside a field the ribbon cannot sort by.
- Tags 5/6: the twins ride the 2D mill's run right after Trace, NOT
  appended at the table end as first planned. The gate's M6.2 ribbon
  test (`sections_partition_the_registry`) proves each family's rows
  form one contiguous run - an append would put two Mill2D kinds
  inside the turning ladder and fail that law. The cost of the
  middle insert is stated honestly: every later row shifts +2, so
  Drill..BoringTurning's cached stamps read Stale exactly once (the
  tag is the digest's head byte) and regenerate byte-identically;
  saved ribbon pins, which are table indices, ride a new v42 -> v43
  ladder rung in `apply.rs` (`idx >= 5 -> idx + 2` - the PostDto
  law: names survive growth, indices need a rung), and a test in
  ribbon.rs walks a v42 file to prove it. Two laws came out of the
  fix that the append first hid: the OpType ENUM's declaration order
  IS the table order (`OpType as usize` is used as a table index in
  six test files), now pinned by `row.ty as usize == i` in the
  registry law; and every ordinal read in a test went from a bare
  literal to `OpType::X.ordinal()` / `as usize`, so the next
  mid-run move cannot silently retarget a test.
- 2D Offset has NO engagement field at all (the variant drops it),
  while its kernel call pins `max_engagement: 45.0` - inert, because
  the pocket kernel only reads that number under the Adaptive
  strategy. Chosen over carrying the field and ignoring it: a pane
  must not render a door the kind cannot open (the strategy combo
  is gone from both twins' panes for the same reason - the kind IS
  the strategy), and 45.0 is inside the sane gate's (0, 90] door so
  the pinned value can never itself refuse.
- PROJECT_VERSION 42 -> 43: the two ParamsDto arms are NEW VARIANTS,
  not additive fields - a v42 build meeting them fails on the unknown
  variant name, which is the wrong refusal to read (it names a
  variant instead of a version). The bump makes it a version refusal
  before a serde one; nothing in the v42 shape moved, so v43 files
  keep every other key byte-identical.
- Digest law: the kind tag at the head of the stream already pins
  which ladder runs, so the twins' digest is the pocket's minus the
  strategy byte (and, for Offset, minus the engagement value that
  no longer exists). A retype Pocket(Adaptive) -> 2D Adaptive goes
  Stale exactly once - different tag - and regenerates byte-
  identically; roughing2d.rs's stamp test is the proof of the
  first half, the path-equality tests of the second.
- No new golden files, chosen over dumping `adaptive2d_plate.cl` /
  `offset2d_plate.cl`: the twins are LAW-EQUAL to the pocket run
  they pin, and the equivalence tests assert that against the
  pocket path generated in the same run, which a frozen golden
  cannot (a golden drifts silently the day the pocket itself
  legitimately moves). The pocket's ladders already carry goldens
  (`pocket_waterline_plate_with_island.cl` in the file lane, the
  adaptive engagement discipline in the machining2d suite).
- The gate found one seam the compiler could not: `section_z_of`'s
  top_z match listed Contour|Pocket|Trace but not the twins, so
  `region_for`'s `unwrap_or(Ok(0.0))` fallback sectioned a twin at
  world z=0 - for the test's stock that refused loudly ("no
  material at z = 0.000", never a silent wrong cut - the Prime
  Directive's fallback design working), for a real job it would
  have machined at a plane no height ever named. Fixed to read the
  twins' top_z like the pocket's; the lesson (matches! guards
  compile under exhaustiveness sweeps) got the roughing2d.rs
  doc-level generation tests, which the kernel-level goldens alone
  would have missed it too.
- The pane renders through one shared `roughing2d_pane` helper (the
  pocket's section map with the strategy row removed), the glyph is
  Icon::Pocket (no-new-asset law, the Pocket3D precedent), and the
  closed-chain selection refusal now names the kind the user
  actually picked ("a 2D Adaptive cannot end mid-edge") instead of
  the pocket's word for it - M6.x's refusals-name-the-thing law
  applied at the first site a retype makes the old sentence a lie.
- Provenance review: the two names and their captions are Autodesk's
  published user-documentation vocabulary used behaviorally (what the
  operation does, not how); the ladders themselves are the kernel's
  own M8.1 engagement study and the pocket's waterline tiling, and
  no HSMWorks posts, params tables or text were consulted.

## M2.4 B - the trio: a twin that speaks, a ride the tool defines, a disk authored whole (2026-11-02, stage B)

- Engrave is the trace, renamed: one shared dispatch arm calling
  `machining2d::trace` verbatim, and the acceptance suite proves it
  byte-for-byte (the same numbers under the other name write the same
  program). Chosen over a distinct kernel: engraving a picked closed
  boundary on a face IS what the trace kernel does; a forked copy
  could only drift. The honest gap - a V-bit would cut wider than the
  kerf's claim - is M10.1's tooling question, and until then the disc
  law says so with the sim, not paper.
- The trace-class open-run refusal was the one place the name was a
  literal: the selection.rs catch-all said "Trace machines a closed
  boundary" for every kind that reaches it, so Engrave was refused
  with its twin's word. Fixed the same way M2.4 A fixed the pocket
  arm: the sentence reads `params.kind().info().label`, and the
  trace's own text is unchanged because the registry says "Trace".
- The chamfer's congruence doors (cone kind, cone angle = the
  supplement 180-2*angle, diameter >= 2*width, flute >= width*tan)
  live in the app's dispatch, not the kernel: only there is the Tool
  visible. The kernel states the face law alone (its own numbers'
  doors refuse in the motion suite). Chosen over threading a Tool
  through the kernel - machining2d stays a geometry module that
  knows cut parameters, not catalog objects.
- The flute door quotes a DERIVED depth, and the gate caught it
  speaking float bits: tan(45 degrees) is 0.9999999999999999, so a
  4 mm chamfer was refused as "short of the 3.9999999999999996 mm
  depth". The message now says a tenth (`{:.1}`): the shop's reading
  precision, and a refusal that reads like a bug trains the user to
  distrust refusals. Chosen over an exact-fraction dance or trailing
  -zero trimming: one format spec, honest at every angle (30-degree
  land: "1.7 mm"), no new helper for one message. The door's
  COMPARISON still uses the raw float with its epsilon - only the
  sentence rounds.
- The chamfer has NO bottom_z anywhere - the corner depth
  `top - width*tan(angle)` is computed in one place (`corner_z()`)
  and the pane shows it as a readout, not a field. A second promise
  would be a second law the ride does not keep; the sim verdict (the
  cone atom's face = the kernel's claimed face, to a cell) is what
  makes the derived floor safe rather than merely tidy.
- ToolKind::Taper (Display "chamfer mill", tip_angle = the INCLUDED
  cone angle) and the sim's `cone: Option<f64>` atom (the cotangent
  of the half-angle from the axis, tip-first: the axis path IS the
  move path, per the codebase's own convention - no center lift like
  the ball's). ball+cone together is refused at validation. Chosen
  over modeling the cone from diameter/length ratios: one number
  states the whole cone, and the atom's exactness is what the
  verdict test can then read off the field.
- Circular runs ring-major (each ring's whole ladder before the next
  ring), unlike the pocket's z-major grid: on the vault, ring k's
  planes are cut between the bowl at its band's OUTER edge and the
  previous band's - so every cut stands at or above the bowl under
  every column it sweeps, and the dome is provably never-gouge. The
  center scallop that leaves (the last ring's floor stands above the
  axis floor) is stated in the test, not hidden: rest the rings
  cannot reach is the waterline law's honest remainder. Chosen over
  a column-major z-ladder, which would re-cross settled dome air
  between rings.
- The trio is three new ParamsDto variants, so PROJECT_VERSION
  stepped 43 -> 44 (the v43 rung shifts pin indices by the three
  mid-run row insertions - ribbon.rs walks both rungs chained, and
  the family test's turning boundary is now DERIVED from the table
  instead of a remembered index, so the next mid-run move cannot
  silently retarget it either).
- Retype carries between the twins exactly (every field shared), but
  the trio is not a clique: the chamfer row seeds its own land
  (0.8 mm at 45 degrees) and takes only the heights it has, and the
  circular's disk (center, radius 25, vault off) is authored - a
  trace's bottom would be a lie about a floor the disk never had.
- No new golden files for the trio, same law as M2.4 A: the engrave
  equivalence asserts against the trace generated in the same run,
  and the chamfer/circular laws are exact-number tests (corner
  depth, ring radii, bowl planes) a frozen golden states weaker. The
  13 .nc goldens rode through untouched - the default document's
  path never meets a new kind.
- Provenance review: the three names and captions follow Autodesk's
  published user documentation behaviorally (what the operation
  does); the cone-ride geometry is machine-toolbook law written
  clean-room, the vault is our own stated paraboloid, and the ring
  tiling is the pocket waterline law restricted to a disk. No
  HSMWorks posts, params tables or text consulted.

## M2.4 C - the pair seated in its runs: a circle bored, a helix timed (2026-11-03, stage C)

- The two rows seat MID-RUN (Thread at 10 closing the Mill2D run,
  Bore at 12 behind Drill), tail-append died on the ribbon's own
  tests: `sections_partition_the_registry` demands each section be a
  CONTIGUOUS run in the table and `family_is_derived_not_forked`
  demands Turning stay the trailing run - the first draft tacked
  Bore/Thread at 35/36 and both laws failed on the spot. The lesson
  the ledger keeps: `Section::kinds()` being a filter made a
  tail-append READ fine in the UI, which is not the same as being
  LEGAL - the partition and family laws are the taxonomy, the
  ribbon only draws it. The v44 -> v45 rung therefore takes a
  two-boundary step (the shift the first three rungs never needed):
  old index 10 (Drill) gains +1 for the Thread's seat, old 11 up
  (Pocket3D) gains +2 for the Bore's - ribbon.rs's v44 rung test
  says it in pins, mill2d_c.rs in G-code.
- PROJECT_VERSION 44 -> 45: beyond the pin shift, the two ParamsDto
  arms are NEW VARIANTS, so a v44 build meeting one must refuse with
  the version word, not an unknown-variant serde word - the M2.4
  A/B reading, unchanged. Every OTHER v45 byte is a v44 byte: the
  pair ride `type` and `params`, no old field moved.
- The thread's PITCH is the TOOL's number, not a params field - the
  tap cycle's law read the same way (M1.6's threading already gets
  its pitch from the tool row). A thread mill that cannot state one
  is refused at the app door BY NAME before the kernel's own door
  (which guards its own numbers) sees the job. Chosen over a pitch
  param: two sources of truth for one thread means the pane, the
  digest, and the ride can each believe a different thread.
- The stamp law: current_stamp digests tool.pitch for Thread OPS via
  an operation-scoped clause after the tool-kind match, so a Tap
  tool's pitch change marks the op Stale instead of silently re-
  posting the old helix. Chosen over a guarded arm inside
  `match tool.kind` - the ToolKind::Thread/Form/Taper arms match
  before a later guard could fire, a shadowing the compiler cannot
  show you. Zero churn to every pre-M2.4-C digest (the turning
  insert's pitch stays inert - that ride reads pitch from params
  already): only the two new kinds reach past the clause. The Prime
  Directive's stale-tracking, extended to the pair on day one.
- Bore is the drilling law on a circle, not a second cycle: the
  per-hole entry and floor are the MODEL's (h.top_z = the hole's
  entry_z, hl.bottom overrides every floor at once when authored),
  through holes drop the drill cycle's own exit gift (the kernel
  takes through_allowance = drilling::THROUGH_CLEAR - one law, not
  a second spelling), rings are closed 256-chord circles swept
  stock_to_leave deep with tolerance as the chord sag. A stepped
  hole (the counterbore fold) and a hole no wider than the cutter
  (no circle left inside) are the kernel's named refusals at its
  doors. Entry is hardcoded Entry3D::Plunge with helix_radius
  inert: helical boring into a finished wall is M8.x's entry-family
  question, and this stage does not invent an answer to it - the
  debt is stated here, not hidden in a bool.
- Thread geometry: tangent start rho_0 = R - r (rim stands on the
  wall, cutting from zero), radial depth h = 0.5413 * pitch - the
  ISO 724 internal-thread depth, the one constant the kernel
  borrows from a published standard - turns = max(n_z, n_r) + 1 so
  the ride ends when BOTH jobs (depth and profile) are done, and
  the retract walks the same helix REVERSED at feed. Chosen over a
  rapid out of a fresh flank: pulling a spinning mill straight up
  through a thread it just cut is the gouge the Prime Directive
  names. The axis plunge at rho = 0 is inside the hole's own air -
  legitimate, and the envelope test skips it BY VALUE (rho < 1e-6),
  not with a widened fudge.
- Seeds and panes: the drill's four heights ride both; Bore seeds
  leave 0.0 / tolerance 0.01 (finishing numbers - the kind is the
  final word on the hole), Thread seeds infeed 0.1 (a light pass;
  the validator caps it at the standard's depth for whatever pitch
  the mounted tool states) and opens climb CCW - the standard read
  for a right-hand thread. Neither kind loses its Passes group (the
  trio's exemption law): boring says leave + tolerance, threading
  says radial infeed per pass. The mid-run seats DO need drift-table
  rows (ui tests: the field-labels guard is positional over the milled
  kinds' prefix, and Thread/Drill/Bore now live inside it) - the two
  rows ride beside the drill's, their Geometry a hole list, their
  Heights the drill's promise plus the stepdown's, their Passes the
  one number each kind exists to speak.
- detect_holes answers for the whole hole-list family (Drill/Bore/
  Thread share the z-holes commit) but the radial cross-hole list
  stays the drill's alone - the only ride that stores one. Chosen
  over a third copy of the recognition path, and the non-drill
  refusal says so in its own words now.
- Icons ride reuse, the no-new-asset law: Bore => Icon::Drill (the
  drilling section's glyph should say so), Thread => Icon::Contour
  (a circle peeled to a thread, the Chamfer2D precedent).
- The spindle-sync word stays M3.3's machine-definition question:
  every move this kind posts is plain linear/arc interpolation
  (G1/G2/G3 with Z timed against the angle by the helix itself), so
  a machine that cannot sync C asks nothing extra of it - unlike
  rigid tapping, this path never claims the spindle turns the
  thread. When M3.3 grows machine capabilities, the refusal (if any
  kind ever needs one) gets its door there, on purpose.

- Close-out of M2.4 as a milestone: the goal line reads ✅ with C, and
  the catalog's 3D-offset-pocket ⚠️ (row 78) is RETAGGED to M2.5 by
  decision, not drift. Chosen because the ⚠️ names a 3-D kind and the
  M2.4 goal line speaks only of 2D names - keeping the row under a
  milestone whose goal cannot cover it is the kind of silent status
  debt the Prime Directive's honesty clause forbids. Considered and
  dropped: closing row 78 as "done" because Pocket3D already offsets
  per level - the row's own words say the ladder is "not offsets", and
  that verdict stands. Considered and dropped: a new M2.4 D stage -
  one ⚠️ row does not earn a milestone, and M2.5 is precisely "3-axis
  strategy completeness", the honest home for an offset-shell
  rougher. The prose keeps a pointer at the old seat so the move is
  traceable from either end.

- M2.5 A stage decisions (steep-and-shallow + flat-area finishing):
- SteepShallow is the parallel kernel's TWIN, not a new generator:
  the partition rides `emit_rings` as an `Option<Vec<Sup>>` gate, and
  every other pattern keeps `None` and walks its loops byte for byte
  - the 13 goldens could not drift by construction, not by re-check.
  Considered and dropped: a standalone split generator - it would
  own a second copy of the ladder's choreography (hop, snap, entry),
  and every future law added to the rings would need filing twice.
- The border verdict: a ring sample that touches nothing (a gap in
  the tessellation, a numerically unclassifiable point) RIDES the
  ring - a redundant cut is recoverable, a skipped strip is a
  silent gouge's invitation. All-steep loops pass whole (the
  waterline's exact geometry), all-shallow loops drop to the march.
- Flat-area finishing speaks PHYSICS on the closed dome: the rim
  disc is real floor but unreachable (the cap overhangs it by 2.86
  against a 6 mm ball's belly), and the pole's bands are convex
  chords a resting ball cannot hold. Flat's honest answer is the
  Empty refusal "no floor flatter than one tolerance...", surfaced
  at the command door (status stays Never - nothing wrong can post)
  rather than a toolpath that would gouge the crown on its way to
  the disc. Chosen over shadow-casting the disc "reachable anyway"
  or quietly cutting the pole: both are the silent-wrong answer the
  Prime Directive names as the worst failure.
- On prismatic ground the split is SILENT: the plateau door test
  asserts steep-and-shallow == parallel BYTE FOR BYTE, because the
  march already owns every floor there and the wall rings all touch
  steep. The equality is the law's own test - the partition must
  never drop a cut it does not own. Where it does speak (a dome's
  shallow cap rings) the motion twin pins the difference.
- App-layer Finish3D tests learned their lane: `GenerateOperation`
  carries the full envelope `verify` for the finish family, so the
  operation layer is the verdict lane's cost even for a door test.
  The door rides the five-face plateau (seconds); the dome physics
  rides the motion kernel door (also seconds); the 12x96 dome under
  app verify is minutes in debug and stays OUT of both - no test
  earns a 10-minute ladder slot for a fact the kernel already spoke.
- `steep_stepover` joins the params inert-but-stamped: the ladder
  reads it only under SteepShallow, the digest carries it under all
  patterns (an ask changed is an ask changed), and the v45 -> v46
  DTO rung is pure step-up - old projects keep their paths, the new
  word defaults to the scallop law.

- M2.5 B stage decisions (pencil + corner, the crease pair):
- "Pencil follows hidden rest material" (ROADMAP's hint at the old
  remachining machinery) is read GEOMETRICALLY, not by boolean stock:
  the leftover of a fatter pen against a crease is the band between
  the two balls' tangent loci, and the band has a closed form -
  (r_ref - r) / tan(theta/2) - from the dihedral's own normals.
  Chosen over subtracting the reference ball's swept volume against
  the model and walking the remainder: the boolean route is the
  remachining stack's problem shape (minutes, voxel-bound, and it
  cannot tell a corner from a scallop cusp). The geometric band is
  exact at the seam, answers in microseconds, and refuses honestly
  (band below tolerance = the pen already cleans it). Considered
  and dropped: sampling the offset surface for "where two faces
  touch the ball at once" - same answer, no closed form, and it
  drifts off thin welds.
- Corner is PROVED, not reimplemented: Corner == Pencil whose
  reference ball is the op's own ball, so `corner()` calls the same
  `loci()` with reference = r and the band r/tan(theta/2). The
  idempotence test pins it byte-for-byte on the step pocket - two
  doors, one weld - and `pencil_reference` is inert for Corner as
  if it had never arrived (a Some(99.0) file cuts the identical
  path). Chosen over a separate corner kernel: two code paths on
  one geometry is two chances to disagree.
- Pencil with NO named reference cleans every concave corner whose
  locus rests. The alternative - refuse until a pen is named - was
  dropped because absence already means something honest: with no
  pen, nothing is already cleaned, so every corner hides rest.
  Naming a pen is the user saying "a pen this fat ran before me";
  only bands it could not reach are worth a run. A named pen that
  is not fatter than the ball is Invalid by name ("does not
  exceed") - not a silent no-op - because a reference that hides
  under the tool is authoring nonsense, and nonsense that passes
  quietly is the silent-wrong answer.
- Validation of `pencil_reference` rides EVERY door's `validate`
  before the pattern is read (Waterline refuses NaN the same way):
  an ask that is nonsense is nonsense stamped anywhere - the
  ladder law from v46, reused without a new word for it.
- The seam walk skips, with a NOTE, what it cannot trust: a shared
  edge that the two faces run the SAME way (inconsistent winding)
  or that is not shared by exactly two faces (boundary or
  non-manifold) never yields a guessed locus. Chosen over
  auto-repairing winding by majority: flipping a facet the model
  gave us would rewrite the user's geometry in the kernel's
  opinion; the note keeps the diagnostic loud and the path clean
  where the geometry IS trustworthy.
- Weld joints stay BIT-EXACT through clipping (shrink): clipped
  ends appear only mid-edge, at(i) march samples, while an
  untouched endpoint keeps p0/p1 verbatim. This is what lets a
  closed ring's last point sit back on its first exactly - the
  ring assert in the pocket test (run[4] == run[0]) is a law, not
  a tolerance; a float-drifted weld would post a staircase, not a
  loop.
- Mouth runs are clipped by the neighbouring wall's plane (the
  ball may not cross into it) and by the tip window at the floor
  end, but keep the EXACT corner line at the top: the pocket test
  pins one mouth point at z == top because the corner line itself
  is real geometry - a run that "improves" its own endpoint with
  a clip sample would move the first cut off the seam it follows.
- v47 is a pure step-up (optional `pencil_reference` key, two
  pattern words a v46 file cannot contain, no row moves): the
  rung stamps version only, absence decodes to the answer every
  v46 file ran, and None serializes ABSENT - never null - so the
  DTO stays a fixed point (save, reload, resave byte-identical is
  asserted). A null-defaulting field was the considered
  alternative; every grammar before it made absence the default
  and the files should not grow a second way to say nothing.
- The envelope verdicts for the crease pair measure PARTIAL
  coverage, so they assert gouge against the scan gate
  (TOL + cell^2/2R + eps) and stay silent about rest: rest belongs
  to the full-pattern lanes, and a tangent pass that claims a
  rest verdict it did not earn is the loud-wrong answer wearing a
  clean badge. The 28 ignored verdict tests run at stage close-out
  on the release ladder.
- Process, logged so it is not repeated: a sed touch to a file an
  Edit call was also about to change clobbered two destructuring
  sites in params_impl.rs (E0027 aftermath, fixed same window).
  Large test blocks now ride the temp-file append (Write to the
  job's tmp dir, `cat >>`), never a heredoc or in-place sed where
  quoting and read-state can fight the Edit tool.
- M2.5 A verdict-lane miss, found by M2.5 B's heavy lane and fixed
  here (the cone in the_split_leaves_nothing gouged 0.2 mm):
  `support_at` proved the STOP, never the DESCENT - a tangent
  center can be ball-clear while the plunge column down to it
  crosses a flank. On the cone every vertical center at rho <= 20
  crosses the wall (z_w = 34.641 - 1.732*rho), so the whole base
  disc is plunge-unreachable from clearance, and the march happily
  walked onto it. Chosen fix: a column law - `column_clear` runs
  the same exact dist_seg_tri sweep the envelope scan runs, over
  the r-padded facet boxes, from clearance to candidate center;
  `plunge_support` pairs it with `support_at` and reports the
  trim. Considered and dropped: lifting the whole family to the
  highest reachable z (changes what the march means, and hides
  real rest); sampling the column at fixed steps (a sub-tol miss
  is still a gouge; the exact form costs a bbox reject per facet).
  The trim is DIAGNOSED, not silent: each family counts refused
  samples in a Cell and posts a note ("what hides there stands as
  rest, reported not cut") before the empty-runs return, so a
  model whose ground is all unreachable refuses with a count
  rather than emitting a shorter lie. The march's ramp probe
  (diagonal_ok) deliberately keeps raw support_at - it asks a
  reachability question, not a plunge question, and its answer
  only steers a diagonal that emits nothing.
- Crease passes emit TIPS (pencil/corner lower the locus by r at
  emission; rests, shrink and chain stay center-based internally):
  the envelope convention says moves speak tips, and a kernel that
  posted centers made the scan's +r lift read a silent pass as a
  clean bill - vacuous verdicts in the lane that was made to
  catch exactly that. The valley fixture proved it: its locus ends
  rest 3.587 above the end-fan apex, r = 3.5, and after the fix
  the crease scans measure a real 0.087 of slack instead of
  measuring nothing.
- The note-law was staged where plunges are CERTIFIED (the five
  family sup-closures: raster, radial, spiral, flow, shadow). The
  claim that rings needed no such law - "the tangent-circle law
  provably clears its own column" - rode the first draft of this
  entry and the release lane spent it: the cone verdict gouged
  2.4963 mm, exactly r minus the distance from the FIRST RING's
  plunge column to the flank. The ring's stop is tangent-clear by
  construction, but its entry was choreographed as "plunge from
  the clearance plane down", and the verdict fixture programs
  top_z 30 under a clearance of 25 - that plunge RISES, crossing
  the spire mid-column on every level above tip 18. Chosen fix,
  two parts, both already law elsewhere: the rings' traverse
  plane lifts to meet the cut (`approach_z.max(z_tip)`, the
  march's `trav = clearance.max(z0)` convention, march.rs:300),
  and the entry plunge is column-certified with the same exact
  dist_seg_tri sweep, in the `r - tol` currency leg_clears
  already pays (a loop start is read off the lattice-quantized
  union boundary, a chord-sag inside the true tangent locus -
  asking it for TOUCH_EPS exactness refuses every ring, which is
  how the first cut of this fix failed the debug ladder). A run
  that cannot be entered legally is refused with a counted note,
  as the march refuses its canopy ground. Considered and
  dropped: a blanket `top_z <= clearance_z` law in validate -
  the march has always treated the raised-traverse program as
  legal (the cone twin-kernel test rides it), and refusing it
  mid-M2.5 would rewrite accepted behavior, not fix a gouge.


## M2.5 A verdict-lane miss: the rings' entry was the gouge the partition law was meant to catch (2026-11-03)

**What happened.** M2.5 A closed with the `the_split_twin_kernels_agree_on_the_cone`
verdict left failing: I recorded it as "an entry-law artifact of steep-ring
entries - the twin's agreement is solid; the entry law stays M2.5's open
flag" and moved on to B. The release heavy lane says that call was wrong:
at HEAD the verdict reports 2.4963 mm of gouge - six hundred times the gate
- and the probe trace pins every part of it to `emit_rings`' entry moves.
The flag was not "deferred"; it was live, and B's audit inherited a false
premise from it ("rings never call support_at, the partition never asks")
that the diagnosis below falsifies. Recorded here so the ledger tells the
truth: this is an M2.5 A miss, fixed under M2.5 B's close-out.

**Root cause, measured.** The fixture's first ring sits at tip Z 30, above
`clearance_z` 25. The entry block wrote the approach at `cur.z`/`clearance_z`
and the second move at `hop` (= tip + r = 33): for a ring above the
clearance plane the "plunge" *rises* 25 → 33 with its whole column inside
the flank. The ball at tip 30 touches the cone by construction (tangent
center); every point above it along that column is *inside* the solid.
`d(center→flank) = 0.5037`, `r − d = 2.4963` - the exact verdict number,
then again at 21 (2.4954) and 12 (2.4952). The "diameter-crossing chords"
I blamed were arc-sagitta artifacts of the debug printer: `centers()` skips
`MoveKind::Rapid` but arcs ride under `MoveKind::Feed` with `arc=Some`, so
the probe drew chord lines across circles the machine actually traveled
as arcs. The clipper-union degeneracy theory from the previous session was
also wrong (probe: the cone's forbidden-center polygon is a clean 224-point
CCW circle at both 8 and 128 scan dirs).

**The fix, by the module's own two laws.** (1) *Raised traverse*:
`approach_z = max(z_tip, …)`, the convention `march.rs` already ships for
waterline entries - a level above the clearance plane is reached at its own
plane, never by an upward plunge. (2) *Entry certification*: the descent
into a ring's start is now a support question - `column_clear` over the
plunge column - because "the tangent stop is clear by construction" was
exactly the claim that let the rise through. The certification thread
`r − tol`, not `r − TOUCH_EPS`: a lattice-quantized ring-loop start sits
a chord-sag inside the true locus (the same debt `leg_clears` states), so
an analytic-center tolerance would refuse every ring (first cut proved it:
3 debug tests flipped to `Empty`). Refused runs are *counted by note*
("plunge column … stands as rest, reported not cut") - the march's
canopy-refusal form, per "never silence". `column_clear` gained the
`limit` parameter; `plunge_support` passes `r − TOUCH_EPS` (its centers
are analytic).

**Verification.** Debug ladder green (finish3d 33, motion lib 76, app/ui
sim suites, 13 .nc goldens byte-identical, clippy clean on
motion/sim/app/ui). Release `--ignored` lanes: finish3d 28/28 incl. the
twice-"flaky" cone verdict, now passing honestly at 0.42 s (the flakiness
claim was a misdiagnosis of this same gouge drifting past the assert).
`overhang_is_caught_by_the_measurement` asserted the *violation* as law
("the M2.2 entry law is exactly what produces it"); the entry law now
refuses those plunges instead of performing them, so the test asserts the
new contract: bound clean, refusal by note, verifier warning on the rest.

**Considered and dropped.** (R1) blanket `validate()` refusal of
`top_z > clearance_z` - contradicts march's accepted raised-traverse
convention and would flip two non-ignored tests; the right law is
per-entry certification, not a parameter veto. (R2) keeping the approach
at `hop` alone - fixes the first plunge but leaves level-to-level moves
climbing to `clearance_z` under a canopy; the certification is what makes
any entry honest, so the raised approach is merely the cheap case of it.

## M2.5 C - the ramp twin, the morph spiral's local law, the geodesic's boundary demand (2026-11-04)

**Ramp: a flag's twin, not a fourth march.** The catalog's sloped-line
pattern is app-forced onto the proven parallel law: `generate.rs` takes
`FinishPattern::Ramp` and sets `q.pattern = Parallel; q.ramp = true;
q.entry_ramp = true` before the march. Every link law M8.2 B certified
(diagonal chain, `leg_clears` on each dive point) then applies verbatim,
and the registry test proves the twin identity: moves("FR") ==
moves("FQ") where FR carries the Ramp kind and FQ the identical explicit
flags - and both differ from the plain parallel FP. Considered and
dropped: a dedicated ramp generator - it would fork the link law that
M8.2's whole verdict lane certified, and a second implementation of one
law is exactly the drift M4's reuse phase exists to prevent.

**Morphed spiral: one turn's spacing is that turn's own.** `polar.rs`
marches the spiral family; the morph variant asks the surface where each
stepover should land instead of a global pitch - local cos-law spacing
from `support_grad` / the new `plunge_support_grad` (the gradient of
plunge support, so the stepover shrinks where the wall steepens). The
wedge fixture proves a spiral that tightens its rings against the slope
and still clears the verifier.

**Geodesic: it demands an open boundary, by name.** `geodesic.rs` welds
the mesh by vertex key, solves the exact boundary-distance field
(Dijkstra over face adjacency, weighted by the shared edge), and cuts
the toolpath at iso-distance contours - rings that march inward from
the part's own rim. A closed shell has no rim to march from and no
honest seed exists, so it is refused at parameter-validation depth:
GenError::Invalid "geodesic needs an open boundary to march from - this
model is a closed shell", surfaced through the operation layer as a
Machining error. Considered and dropped: marching from a face chosen as
a pseudo-source - plausible-looking paths with no specced meaning is the
silent-wrong-answer shape the Prime Directive forbids. The app witness
(the stage-C test's FG row) needed the plateau's base quad added: the
closed-shell refusal triggers only when *every* rim edge is paired, and
the fixture was an open-bottom box. No metal moved in the twin rows -
adding a floor the cutter never reaches changes no moves.

**Support-kernel currency: what a candidate may propose, and what the
clearance decides.** An earlier draft of this section claimed the
tolerance now THREADS through `ball_clear`/`plunge_support`/`support_at`
(`r − tol`). That threading was tried, measured against the corrugated
belt, and REVERTED: the belt's one envelope deviation (0.0317 mm, in the
ring-close's fitted arcs, endpoints exactly tangent, the same number the
`tol/4` XY-sagitta budget predicts on a 22.5° face) appears identically
under threaded and exact laws - the threading fixed nothing, and a
center allowed to bury `tol` into a facet is a center the kernel
promises NOT to bury. Every clearance question stays at HEAD's exact
currency `r − TOUCH_EPS`.

What stage C adds is a CANDIDATE law, and it lives in exactly one
place: `tangent_z_folded`. The strict `tangent_z` (march ground, rings,
shadow, flat - every family that CUTS) keeps HEAD's 1e-9 barycentric
hair: where no facet's plane owns a tangent foot there is no rest, the
run BREAKS, and the crease gap between adjacent breaks is the staircase
the minimum-step law is specced against (`minimum_step_floors_the_
refinement_not_the_edges`: 324/302/258/236/236 feeds across the rungs).
The folded variant (inside exact; near-miss allowed with `wmin ≥ −0.15`
and per-edge caps `max(0.05·r, 0.02·h_edge)` - slack proportional to the
tessellation, never a global fudge) answers only `support_grad`, the
morph table's slope lookup - a reading that RUNS NO CUT, so a wider
answer can only widen a spacing, and the 45° jurisdiction clamp bounds
what that can cost. It was tried on the whole kernel once, on the theory
that candidates only propose and `ball_clear` decides: true about
safety, and it still destroyed the belt's staircase - edge-resting
centers that a straddling ball legitimately HAS answered the march
where the module's promise says BREAK. A law's promise outranks a looser
answer; the slack went where it cannot speak through a cut move.

Two verdicts followed the narrowing, both restored to HEAD semantics:
`flat` on the closed dome answers its Empty refusal again (the apex
star was a fold-rest the plane law cannot own - M7.1's brick-SDF
territory, the same jurisdiction the dome march's hole note names), and
the morphed-spiral cap test reads its spacing PER FRAGMENT binned by
radius instead of per stitched turn (fragmentation at tessellation
crests IS the strict law's honest output; the within-band azimuthal
quantization of the 16-node table is averaged out by construction).
Considered and dropped: family-specific kernels for the polar march
(spacing laws speak on contiguous ground - a family that quietly keeps
a looser ground is two kernels, not one exception); folding the table's
noise away by densifying the node grid (the table's currency is its own
spacing promise, not the march's).

## M2.5 C verdict-lane: a closed ring rotates to a clean start - and the test it had been hiding (2026-11-04)

**What happened.** The rotary app test failed under stage C's kernel and
bisected to *HEAD itself*: it has been failing since 6dbf94d (M2.5 A
verdict-lane), and B's close-out missed it because the gate binary ran
under a name filter that matched nothing - `--exact` plus a substring
pattern silently executed 0 tests and exited 0 green. A filter that can
run zero tests is not a gate. Recorded so the ledger carries both the
fix and the process miss.

**Root cause, measured.** On the laid stepped bar (r6 → cone 6→5 → r5,
stations −16..16) the bottom rung's ring (the −3.8590/−4 pair on the
r5 flank) is a clean ccw loop, but the scan's start vertex
(−1.8556, −8.8844) sits at the r6→cone shoulder: the plunge column from
`approach_z` passes 2.888 from the corner edge, under the currency
r − tol = 2.9, so 6dbf94d's entry certification refused the *whole
ring* for the crime of its starting vertex. The region exists; the
entry point was poisoned.

**The fix: a closed ring is a cycle, and its start is a choice.** When
the head vertex's column is blocked, `rings.rs` rotates the loop to the
first stride-sampled vertex whose column certifies clear - ≤ 256 tests
at the same `r − tol` currency, then re-fits the arcs - before any
refusal note is written. Nothing is softened: if no vertex clears, the
refusal stands, counted by note as before. Open runs keep their head
(their ends are the spec); the `entry_ramp` path is untouched (M8.2 B
certifies each dive point already). Considered and dropped: refusing
the rung as before (wrong - the metal is reachable); entering by
retract-and-traverse from another rung's endpoint (rewrites the ring
family's link law for one fixture's geometry); lowering the currency
(the certification is the law this fix honors, not its obstacle).

**Gate-filter law, learned.** Every gate report must show per-binary
test counts; "0 passed; N filtered out" under a name filter is RED by
definition. Both this stage's binaries and the close-out ladder now
state expected counts, and a zero-test run is a failure to report, not
a pass.

## M2.5 D1 - Blend: where the border moves, and what it costs (2026-11-04)

**Chosen: the band line at 30°, ride BOTH families there.** The
transition between the floor's law (raster) and the wall's law (the
ring ladder) had one border at 45°, and the border's staircase was the
price of the clean split. Blend moves the RINGS' claim down to any
loop whose tangency reaches past 30° - `BLEND_MZ = cos 30°` on the
sky-pointed normal, the same reading the SteepShallow split already
uses - and leaves the raster exactly where Parallel puts it. The
transition band is then cut twice, from both directions. Considered
and dropped: a dedicated band kernel (a third placement for a spacing
question two placements already answer - the seam would itself need a
border); moving the border instead of doubling it (that is
SteepShallow, already shipped, and its verdict is the staircase).

**The cost, computed before it was paid.** A ring cusp on a tilt α is
`Δz²/(8r·cos²α)`: at 30° that is 4/3 of the ladder's promise, at 45°
2x. So the band's second cut is a SHAVE of metal the raster already
nearly reached, never a re-cut at full scallop - double-cutting the
band spends time, not surface. This is why 30 and not 20 (where the
ring's cos² inflation starts eating its own promise) and not 40
(where the band shrinks back toward the staircase).

**Two law-tests carry the design.** On a 38° sheet Blend's feed count
sits strictly between Waterline-and-SteepShallow (the band arrived)
and Parallel (`band ⊆ steep`: the blend rides a superset of the
partition's ring claims). And on ground with no transition the twin
law: Blend == SteepShallow byte-for-byte on the box and == Parallel
byte-for-byte on the all-steep cone - `ring_runs`' all-true fast path
is what makes the identity exact, so the pattern cannot leak a
different choreography onto terrain that has no band to ride.

**Findings the tests told us.** The plunge-count assertion was wrong
and is gone: the band's extra runs do not each buy their own Plunge -
runs joining one ring's walk ride its existing entry. And the
dust-mote mesh is Ok-or-Err, not Err, for the raster/ring families:
the ball-radius tangent circle about a point is honest geometry; the
`degenerate_meshes_never_panic` law demands an answer, and the Blend
door test asserts it answers. The NaN facet still refuses by name
(validate's finiteness door, the shared one).

**UI fields: no gating change.** Blend shows stepover (its raster
obys), min_step/ramp/entry_ramp (the rings honor them, as
rings_and_tail's callers always have); steep_stepover stays
SteepShallow-only because Blend's ring spacing is the ladder's own
scallop law, not a stated flank number - the pane says what the
kernel spends.

## M2.5 D2 - Morph: the loft's Z is the column's, never the ruler's (2026-11-04)

**What the pattern is.** Between consecutive waterline rings the tool
rides ONE interpolated guide per paired gap - the `t = 1/2` ruling
between the two tangent loops. Halving the level spacing quarters the
cusp (`Δz²/(8r)` at the midpoint), so Morph shows the ladder's promise
at a quarter of the Z budget. It attacks the same cusp the ramp and
blend strategies ride, from the other side: they move where the rings
sit; Morph adds a path between them.

**The Z law, chosen against the obvious construction.** The guide's XY
is the interpolation's, but its Z is grounded sample by sample by
`plunge_support` - the march families' own currency. Considered and
dropped: averaging the two rings' Z (a linear chord between levels
lies under canopies and stands over cusps - it would promise support
the surface doesn't give, the one thing the Prime Directive names);
carrying the loft as a raw polyline without the march (no
climb-gate, no trim-when-refused, no hop law). Grounded instead, a
refused sample breaks the run at the hop and counts a note, and what
hides there stands as rest, reported not cut.

**Pairing: area-rank, gated by a tool diameter.** Components of
consecutive levels match by |area| rank (the ring walker's own
emission order - two truths, one code) and a centroid-proximity gate:
centroids further apart than `2r` are a feature appearing or dying (a
hole closing, an island dying), not a wall continuing - nothing pairs,
no loft is written, and the rings alone carry that level change
exactly as the ladder did before this file existed. Considered and
dropped: index pairing (the region walker's order is not feature
order across levels), Hausdorff matching (a full similarity search
for a question one distance answers).

**The seam makes the phase deterministic.** Both loops are resampled
to a common count walked from each loop's furthest +X vertex from the
signed centroid, so two levels of the same feature start their arc at
the same phase (the scan direction set is shared, so seams land in
the same quadrant). Considered and dropped: arbitrary-start resample
(a seam half a loop away interpolates a figure-eight through the
solid), arc-length-parameter-only (still rotates the phase wherever
the loop's own vertex counts differ).

**The identity law.** A single-level ladder (top = bottom) lofts
nothing, and Morph is Waterline byte for byte - `emit_rings`' ordinary
walk with the pattern check neither steep nor band. The door test
holds both halves: on a 38° sheet Morph's feed count strictly exceeds
Waterline's (the lofts arrived), and `last = Some(clearance)` makes
the ring part identical to the ladder's own.

**Row 93 stays 📋 until D3.** The Morph row is shared with the
Project generalization (draping the model's own boundary loops, not
just its silhouette shadow): the strategy the row names is shipped
and green, and the row flips when the drape lands.

**Finding the gate told us: a pin rots silently if nobody's ladder
steps on it.** `mill2d_c` hard-pinned the literal `"version":45`;
PROJECT_VERSION rode 45→46→47 through M2.5 A/B - whose narrow gates
never included that suite - and the test went RED without any of
those diffs touching it. The assert now PARSES the stated version and
checks the range `45..=PROJECT_VERSION` (the grammar floor stays
exact). The lesson for every future version assert: state the floor,
bound by the head, never pin a literal that bumps carry past.

## M2.5 D3 - Project generalization: drape the part's own edges, not just their shadow (2026-11-04)

**What was chosen.** Project now walks TWO curve families: the
center-shadow silhouette it always marched (M2.2e, untouched law,
untouched bytes), and then every CLOSED boundary loop the mesh itself
carries - a trim's rim, a hole's edge - XY kept exactly, Z answered
by the column law (`plunge_support`), marched by the very
`march_loop` the shadow families ride. The tilted plate's hole is cut
where the plate's edge STANDS, not where its shadow falls. Provenance
stays public-behavior-only ("projected finishing" is machine-handbook
vocabulary); the construction - weld-scaled open-edge chaining onto
crease.rs' chain walk - is ours, two truths one code.

**One weld law for the whole family.** `vkey`/`vkey_scale` lived twice
(pencil.rs, geodesic.rs); the drape needed the same third time, so
the pair was LIFTED into crease.rs and both copies deleted - the
drape's boundary chain, the loci's locus chain and the geodesic's
contour chain now weld the same mesh the same way, by construction
rather than by copy-paste discipline. Considered and dropped: a third
private copy (what the drape draft was), and a weld trait (a
one-function abstraction for two call sites' worth of code).

**The crack branch found real garbage in the house.** Refusal by
count - open runs are NAMED in a note and draped as NOTHING -
resisted every synthetic fixture: with both orientations collected,
welded keys and closing-beats-ties, every constructible planar mesh
chains closed (nine contortions tried: bowties, slits, T-junctions,
whiskers - all closed). The branch needed no contortion: the repo's
OWN `box_facets` fixture hides a bowtie bottom - three valence-1
edges chaining into one open diagonal run - and the drape is the
first code here to report it. Chosen: keep the fixture (its envelope
suites pass with it, and it is now a working crack corpus at zero
cost), add `closed_box()` beside it to prove the silence half of the
law. The `a_crack_is_named_and_never_draped_as_if_closed` test
asserts both halves: the note names one run, and no feed stands on
the diagonals.

**Up-slope edges open; that is the law, not a bug.** A rim sample is
supported where the ball's CONTACT (`center − r·m_xy`) rests on a
real facet - on a tilted sheet that is the down-slope edges. The
drape test asserts y = 10 and x = −3 exactly; the opposite edges
break under the march's own break law, counted by geometry and never
hidden (an envelope-verdict test on an OPEN sheet was considered and
dropped: a phantom back side is what the height-field measure cannot
see - tilted()'s own doc says so; the goldens carry the closed-solid
identity instead).

**Byte-identity is the safety law, and it is structural.** A closed
manifold has no open edge, so `boundary_loops` returns empty before a
sample, no note is written, and Project answers exactly as before
this file existed - every solid-model golden rides byte-identical
(the gate's porcelain check is the proof).

**The app layer changed not one line.** Project's dispatch door
(`generate.rs`), the operations word-table and the round-trip
coverage all predate D3 - a generalization that needed new plumbing
would have been the wrong generalization. Only the pages.rs tooltip
grew the drape's sentence.

## M2.5 E A - the flowline's 3-axis door, and the reach law that had to learn to skip (2026-11-04)

**Flow lives once.** `FinishPattern::Flow` runs `multiaxis::flow3d` -
`flow5d`'s own `build_field`, traced with NO `stamp_axes`, no
`AxisControl`, no shank: the field's least-curving grain steers the
lines, the tool axis stays vertical because there was never a second
law to drift from. Considered and dropped: a finishing3d-local copy of
the field (two truths, the rot the catalog's twin kinds were built to
avoid). The congruence proof is the kernel test itself: same tube,
lattice-equal cut positions, `axis: None` everywhere.

**The pattern word is additive.** `FinishPattern::Flow` enters the DTO
as a word in the pattern enum (like blend/morph), so no OpParams
version bump - the round-trip test speaks "flow" as a word.

**The door rides a COARSE barrel.** 12x4 capped cylinder, crown z=24,
tol 0.1 - quick-ladder law (no minutes-long generation in a `#[test]`);
the dome-scale verdicts are the ignored lane's. The F5 twin (Waterline
over the same barrel) is the alias witness: if Flow were a disguised
ladder the paths would match; they must not, and the 3-axis path must
stay `is_prismatic`.

**The stall was the verify engine, not the kernel - and its fixes are
laws, not flags.** The app door ran minutes while the kernel took
193 ms. Three permanent corrections, each an exact restatement of the
predicate it replaced (gate: 90 porcelain goldens byte-clean + the
full verdict lane):

- `surface()` searched the cut list deepest-first, learning the answer
  one clone at a time. The island clause is a MONOTONE threshold in z
  (q is inside the slice above z exactly while z < h(q) - the slice IS
  the part above z), so the first clearing chord is the first in-reach
  chord at or above a binary-searchable threshold; the upward walk
  keeps the full island test as the belt - a mesh that lied about
  monotonicity would still convict exactly.
- `island_holds` asks the island cache the membership question without
  cloning the plane's Region; a continuous-Z path probes thousands of
  cached planes per program and the clone-per-probe was minutes of
  allocator for zero verdict.
- The (c) reach band now skips whole bands whose floor stands at or
  above the stock top: `surface` ends in `.min(stock_top_z)`, so such
  a band cannot convict in any column - the same predicate read one
  step earlier. On a level ladder the test rarely fires; a flowline's
  1977 distinct planes made the blind ask the story.

`part_at`'s per-call `islands_at` was hoisted out of the closure for
the same reason. Doctrine cited: `sweep.rs`'s column memo (pure column
answers ride the memo), applied at the island law.

**The door's verdict cost: none.** verify answers 0 warns on the
barrel in ~330 ms; law (f)'s envelope scan (241 ms) is now the floor -
honest, it is the rest-material verdict itself.

## M2.5 E B - the deburr seats in the Mill3D run, and the door the tool law already closed (2026-11-04)

**The row seats inside the run, not at the tail.** Deburr takes index
15, after Finish3D, because the contiguity law will not abide a
tail-append for a Mill3D kind (same reason M2.4 C seated Bore and
Thread IN their runs). The rung is one boundary: v47 -> v48 shifts
`pinned` indices >= 15 by +1 - the same partition the registry's
section rows read. Considered and dropped: seat at 37 (breaks the run
into a lie) and reuse of a hole (no law says an index is free). The
v42/v43/v44 pin tests recomposed for the fourth rung, their chain
comments the file's proof that rungs compose, not overwrite.

**The ride needs one authored number.** `drop = width /
tan(half-angle)` puts the virtual tip under the edge and the cone's
surface meets the edge's plane at exactly `width` - so the break's
DEPTH is the TOOL's word, derived, never a second number to disagree
(the chamfer grammar on a real dihedral, and the 45-deg congruence
test says it in bytes: same XY circuit `chamfer.rs` posts, quantized
to microns, which no real disagreement survives). No XY offset
exists to get wrong: a vertical-axis cone over a convex edge lies
over it, material under. The loci are pencil's mirror - the crease
gate reads the other way (keep the pair that fails "both opposite
vertices above"), rims welded in 3D because the drape's boundary walk
flattens to XY to ground Z and this ride needs the loop's own Z. The
window clips tips by the segment's own line; an edge nothing exposes
answers `Empty` by name.

**No retract key in the grammar.** The kernel hops to `clearance_z`
between every edge run - a programmed retract would be a second
truth about the same hop, and `ParamsDto::Deburr` carries six keys,
not seven. Dropped: a retract field "for symmetry" with Contour.

**The angle door is defense-in-depth, and the test proved it from
both sides.** `AddTool`'s `is_sane` (Taper wants `0 < tip_angle <
180`, the global bound under a flat) makes a 180-deg cone
UNMOUNTABLE - the generate door's `!(0.0..180.0)` can never fire
through the command layer. The test asserts both: AddTool refuses the
mount by the sanity law, then writes the `ToolDef` straight onto the
entity (the machine.rs:760 idiom) so the kernel's own door meets the
shape the command law can no longer produce. Considered and dropped:
deleting the generate door as "unreachable" - the direct-write path
is exactly what a future step-up or a corrupt-mirror mount would
take, and the door is the last layer, per the Prime Directive's
validate-early-plus-late.

**The flute door reads the slant, not the drop.** The cone reaches a
`width` break at slant distance `width / sin(half-angle)` up its
flank - shorter flute than that and the cylinder above the cone would
ride the wall, so the door says it in millimetres ("the break reaches
7.1 mm up the cone's flank"). Dropped: comparing `flute_len` to the
drop alone (that's the Z reach; the cut lives on the flank).

**The happy fixture breaks the top rim only.** A cone cannot deburr
a bottom rim from above - its body would stand INSIDE the wall - so
the window [6, 8] over a brick's rims admits exactly the top circuit
and the honest program says so; the bottom rim's tips (z = -2, drop
2) clip under `bottom_z + drop` by the window law itself. A fixture
that "deburred" both rims would have been a gouge the verifier
catches and the post refuses - designed out.

**UI words: the pane borrows its icon from Contour** (the edge-ride
glyph is the same circuit-follow; a deburr-only glyph invented a
difference the operation doesn't have), **names the window fields
"Window Top Z" / "Window Bottom Z"** (a bare "Top Z" would promise
the Heights group's model-relative pair; these bound the EDGE
window, a different thing), and **excludes Passes** from the pane
(the drift-guard table carries the 16th row): one authored break, no
stock-to-leave, no stepdown - a deburr is a single pass over exposed
edges, a law the seed states as plainly as the kernel does.

**Staleness debt: none.** New PARAMS variant means no old file can
carry it, so no digest word rides into existing ops' stamps - the
one-time-Stale the step-up law accepts (the M5.3 C/D precedent) is
the price for appending words to EXISTING variants; `Deburr`'s fold
(width, the window's planes, clearance, both feeds - the cone itself
already rides the tool revision) only ever salts ops that were born
with it.

## M2.5 F A - the shell rides the roof, and the dome's helix exposed the bore's half-certified tube (2026-11-05, stage A)

**The lift's shape: per-vertex tips, not per-level planes.** Every XY cut
leg is subdivided to chords of at most the tool radius, and every
vertex's Z is `min(plane, roof(q, r + cap) + leave).max(plane - stepdown,
bottom_z)` with `roof` the highest facet-zmax whose AABB reaches the
decision disc. Considered and dropped: one tip per level (the rings
would ride a sampled surface but the LEGS between samples would cut
straight through relief the endpoints' discs never saw - the stepped
fixture's vertical-dive-beside-a-step is the concrete counterexample:
the previous leg is long while the vertex's own disc is short, and at
the crossing the interpolated Z rides below the step's surface - a
gouge the sim names). The cap costs vertices, not depth: within one
planar facet the tips along a leg are equal anyway, so subdivision adds
only collinear co-planar points - the prismatic-equivalence test measures
that move for move. A coarse mesh may name a high vertex no point of the
tube reaches, and the tip rides UP toward the plane: that is the plain
ladder's own cut, never deeper, never a gouge - conservative on the safe
side by construction.

**Links and ramps stay straight, with one discipline.** The hop's
airline and the dive's link ride the tips of their endpoints - a tilted
chord over relief is what the tip law means. The ramp is the exception
the Crossing law forces: a tilted ring pair sharing XY space with the
plain ladder's flat rows can overlap them in Z over a POSITIVE interval
(verify's law tolerates only zero-touch grazes, which is what plain
entries make by the superset law), so the shell's ramp rides strictly
above the plane until one chord short of its destination and only then
descends to the destination's tip. Considered and dropped: subdividing
the ramp diagonal too (its chords would re-cross the ring's own plane-
rows at mid-Z - the cap helps legs under relief, not diagonals ACROSS
tilted rows).

**The dome's helix found a plain-ladder law bug, not a shell bug.** The
fixture's Helix entry gouged (sim: move ~193; A/B: the PLAIN
`pocket3d` on the same model flags Gouge at its own move 59). Root
cause: `helix_down` orbits the circle whose NEAR SIDE is the dive point
(`center = xy + (rh, 0)`), but all three helix arms asked the dive-room
margin OF THE ANCHOR. A margin that certifies the tube needs
dist(ORBIT CENTER) >= rh in the tool-eroded space; one radius asked from
the anchor certified half the tube: the far side bit rh deep into
curved relief (dome: tube reached 3.779 from the axis, island r = 5).
Stage A's shipped fix (0c99db5) widened the ask to `2*rh` from the
anchor - sufficient, but SUFFICIENT IS NOT EXACT, and the app's
operations suite proved it at this stage's gate: M8.2's slot orbit
(channel 12, tool 6, rh 2 - max center-room 3.0, asked 4.001) lost its
arcs to the substitution law. The final law is the CENTER CONVENTION:
keep the ask at `rh + 1e-3` but take the FOUND point as the orbit's
center, and start the dive at the anchor `found - (rh, 0)`. Exactness
is one line: the certified disc IS the tube's projection, and the
anchor lies inside the certified disc by the triangle inequality - so
every arc point is a proven tool center, straight walls AND curved
relief, with no radius of over-ask to refuse legitimate channels. Fixed
at the same three call sites + `entry::dive_room`'s doc, which now
states the convention. Considered and dropped: (a) keeping stage A's
2-rh ask - over-refusal is also a wrong answer, the sim's slot suite
names it; (b) orbiting about the anchor as found (ask rh, center =
anchor) - that's the ORIGINAL bug restated; (c) leaving the plain
ladders' law and fixing only the shell's copy - the bug is the plain
ladder's, the shell merely met it. Gate lesson recorded: stage A's
ladder ran MOTION binaries only; the regression lived in an APP-lane
test.

**A landed bore is not yet a clean one: the lifted-leg guard, level
-10.** Under stage A's `2*rh`-from-anchor ask the dome's deepest level
refused every landing point (the ring-with-hole center is a 2.5-wide
channel: island eroded to 9, walls to 14, nothing clears 4.001) and the
arm substituted by the no-room law. The center convention CHANGES that
verdict: at (-8.46, 9.29) the widened disc has certified room and the
bore LANDS - and landing is not the end of the law. The shell's -5.0
rows stand LIFTED, their tips riding the dome's roof between -10 and
-5, so a descending arc crossing one of those rows overlaps it in Z
over a POSITIVE interval - the verifier names it Crossing, exactly the
pair-of-moves law that tolerates only the measure-zero graze a FLAT
ladder's rows make (a flat row at pz and a bore ending at pz share a
plane, not an interval; that is why the plain pocket's helix never
needed this guard, and why the slot channel - 3.0 of center-room
against a 2.0 ask, LANDS with its arcs - stays green by the same
construction). So the helix arm asks one more question before it
dives: does any planned leg's XY reach the orbit circle while its
PREVIOUS-plane tips' Z interval overlaps the bore's band? Sampled at
the cap's chords, conservative by the same AABB overshoot the tip law
itself carries; nonsense geometry answers YES (refuse loudly, never
bite). If it does, the arm substitutes the noted axial dive - the one
motion the Crossing law cannot name, sharing no XY ground with
anything - and the level walks on. Completeness: a leg's XY is
level-invariant (one tiling at every plane), and legs two planes above
the floor stand at >= pz - they cannot reach a band the bore ends
above - so only the previous plane's legs are asked. Considered and
dropped: (a) letting it land and letting verify refuse the whole path -
generation can fix this locally and say so; a refusal at the wrong door
loses the cut; (b) re-routing the bore's XY plan around lifted rows -
the shell's seam is that Z answers the model, XY answers the plan, and
moving XY to dodge a Z fact is that seam inverted; (c) skipping the
sampling near crossings silently - the Prime Directive's
fallback-is-said law: the note names the lifted legs by name, every
time ("entry: the shell lifts legs the bore would cross - axial dive on
the floor instead").

## M2.5 F B - the seam: a switch, not a second parameter world (2026-11-05, stage B)

**Chosen: the app dispatches among the eight `pocket3d*` verbs on a
new `OpParams::Pocket3D.shell` bool - motion's `Pocket3DParams` gains
nothing.** The ROADMAP sketch said "a shell flag on the params"; the
plan's wording rode that. Deviation, reasoned: `Pocket3DParams` is the
engine's numeric input - its fields feed `validate()` and the tip law -
and the choice of WHICH engine runs is the caller's seam, already
expressed by which of the plain/offset x mask/rest functions
`generate.rs` names. A field there would either be ignored by four of
the eight entry points (a lie in the struct) or force motion to fork
inside itself (the split this crate's API exists to avoid). The four-
arm match `(*shell, *rest_rough)` reuses the exact mask/rest plumbing
the ladder proved: shell rides the same prior grid, the same rest note
discards. Considered and dropped: a `strategy` variant "OffsetShells"
(the kind's combo would gain a word that silently retires the other
four - the wire-grammar law's exact taboo).

**The wire rides the slot's M8.2 C pattern: one appended
`#[serde(default)]` key, NO PROJECT_VERSION bump.** Absent decodes to
false, which is exactly what every pre-shell file generated - a pure
step-up; the bump M2.5 A/B made carried NEW ENUM WORDS an old file can
never hold, which a bool key is not. The digest bytes match: shell is
`write_u8` APPENDED after `feed_opt`, so every pre-shell operation's
stamp stays byte-identical - nothing false-Stales, and the new
`shell_splitsthe_stamp`-style assert (operation/tests.rs) proves the
flag is heard at all. The round-trip test states the version through
`project::PROJECT_VERSION` - the pin-rot lesson from the `mill2d_c`
finding, not a literal. The absent-means-off strip is JSON surgery
through `get_mut` chains, never an index chain: serde_json's mutable
indexing UPGRADES a missing key through Null into an object, which
grafted a phantom `operation: {params: {pocket3d: null}}` onto the
tool row - and the loader refusing that shape by name is the wire
contract working, not a bug to route around (the test was the bug).

**The fresh op seeds OFF; the checkbox says "Offset shells" on Passes,
between Strategy and Entry.** Off is the ladder exactly as it always
generated - the shell is the user's ask, never a new default that
silently rewrites everyone's toolpaths (the same law that made
`rest_rough` seed false). The pane-law table
(`every_field_lives_on_exactly_one_section`) carries the new row; the
description line is bare label text, which the law counts nowhere. The
seam test (`the_shell_switch_sends_the_pocket_to_the_offset_engine`)
runs the cube's vertical walls through BOTH flags and asserts the paths
differ while both verify clean: on vertical walls the shell's tips fall
exactly on the planes, so what moves is the XY plan - rings where
zigzag was - and that is the whole claim a switch can make without a
dome fixture (the dome's geometry law is stage A's own suite).

## M2.5 reference revisit — the placements the papers challenge, closed without re-strategizing (2026-11-05, close-out)

**Chosen: the 45-deg auto-split and the polar-spiral placement stand
re-confirmed, on measured comparison.** The `pdf-sources` papers entered
the graph after those placements were verified, and the ROADMAP's ⚠️
reopened them for review, not repair. Kumazawa/Feng, CAD 2015 (book2)
measures 1.9-8.2% travel savings over a plain iso-scallop seed - but
only on free-form PFD-topology surfaces, and on its own
no-degenerate-point revolution case the proposed paths ARE
circumferential iso-scallop, the family our ring ladder already rides
at the same cusp promise; `SPLIT_MZ = cos 45` (params.rs) is the
scallop law's own jurisdiction limit, which the paper never crosses.
Zhou et al., CAD 2015 (book1)'s 16-26% finish-time win is over
commercial zig-zag/contour-parallel on a fish pocket (Example 5:
2h23m vs 3h13m/2h51m, PDF pp.16-18), while its parametric domain map
degenerates to concentric circles on every fixture in our suite
(dome/cone/box/plateau) - where `spiral()` is already the single
retract-free curve - and its own text admits 3-5 boundary-corner paths
needing tightened scallop, the violations our envelope lane exists to
veto. Considered and dropped: a PFD tensor-field + separatrix
segmentation module (its measured baselines are not ours; on our
fixture class it invents region borders only the verifier would pay
for), and a parametric-domain double-spiral tour (needs S(u,v)
machinery we don't carry, would re-gate every M2.3 verdict, and its
mesh-native cousin - distance-field contours - already shipped as
Geodesic at M2.5 C). The hop-vs-smooth-link tour-closure choice is
unmoved: a hop is a machine movement that is TRUE, a crossing feed is
a crash. M2.1d's feed modulation is unchallenged by either paper; the
NIST doc (RS274/NGC) is the language, not a strategy. No re-gate: the
gate for a revisit that changes nothing is the evidence itself, and
it's in this file's pages.

## M7.1 A — the brick SDF field: five decisions the stage-A law rests on (2026-11-05)

**Chosen: sign by live ray-parity at the query point, magnitude by the
BFS graph value, band truncated on the value and clamped at cap.**
Considered and dropped, decision by decision. (1) A per-column cache
of the CENTER ray's crossings for the sign - O(1) queries, the shape
`solid_rest`'s column walk suggests - is NOT exact: a wall thinner than
a cell passes between the point and its column's center and flips the
answer. The fin test (`a_sub_cell_wall_still_flips_the_sign...`) proves
the error class exists and that the live call survives it; speed rides
stage C's ray-keyed acceleration, honesty now. (2) Hop cost: a six-
neighbor step advances one cell; charging it a full cell over-reports
clearance along diagonals (the direction the dexel header forbids),
charging it `cell / sqrt(3)` makes every straight path's graph cost
its true length plus the seed's half-diagonal at worst - under-report,
which the ROADMAP's subtraction law blesses ("clearance rounds toward
danger, never a hidden gouge"). `HOP = 1/sqrt(3)`, proved in the value
test's lower bound. (3) Truncation: first pass cut on `v <= cap + 2`
alone and let stored values ABOVE `cap` leak into answers - "beyond the
band answers cap" died at true distance 1.5. Second pass cut on hop
count and restored the leak's opposite (in-band cells answering cap at
a diagonal factor's distance short of the band edge). Final law takes
both halves: expand on the value horizon, STORE `min(v, cap)` - the
magnitude is `cap` past the band whether the cell is allocated or not,
and the staircase bound `v <= t + 1.73*cells` proves every cell at
truth <= cap gets stored, so `cap` over-reports by no more than two
cells. The eikonal sweep that makes magnitude exact everywhere is
stage C, per the ROADMAP. (4) Sparsity claimed honestly: an L1 BFS
footprint is an octahedron, so "band 2" stores ~9 cells of reach both
ways; a sphere 100 cells across is ~a third of its box, not 1-5%. The
ROADMAP's "1-5% of the nominal grid" is the clipmap/multi-resolution
regime (M7.1 C), and the test measures the bbox law the stage ships.
(5) Watertightness: every canonical edge used exactly twice - catches
holes AND (mostly) non-manifold joints, the exact precondition parity
needs; the edge key must carry BOTH endpoints by bits (a single-
endpoint key made every edge at a shared vertex "used 6 time(s)" and
refused good boxes - the bug the first build taught). Two disjoint
shells pass the gate and read their overlap as air, which is what
even-odd parity MEANS (the fin test states it; the stage-B subtraction
consumes it unchanged).

Gate note: the R=200 sparsity parameter caught a cell-of-two bug -
`seed_exact` divided its scan bounds by `cell` twice, which is invisible
at cell 1.0 and empty everywhere else. The lattice tests now carry a
non-unit cell each; that is the class the bug belonged to.

## M7.1 B - swept-tool subtraction on the field: six decisions the max layer rests on (2026-11-05)

**Chosen: a second per-cell layer (`cuts`) storing the running max of
the negated swept-tool distances, clamped at cap; the query takes
`max(mesh_term, cut)`.** Considered and dropped, decision by decision.
(1) Re-graphing the field per move, or recomputing the whole sweep's
distance at query time - the first makes every verdict pay every
prior move, the second has no verdict that does not time out; the
stored max is the layer the ROADMAP's "one max() per sample" names,
and it is exactly associative: max commutes, so a replay in any
order answers bit-identically (`the_order_of_moves_changes_nothing`
proves it on 12^3 centers). The dexel only LOOKS order-dependent
because a column stores one Z; its removal is a min over bottoms,
the same commuting law in column clothing.
(2) The swept solid's distance: voxelizing the sweep (marching the
swept volume into the lattice) was dropped for the ROADMAP's
inverted-trajectory law read exactly - the solid is convex and the
sweep is a Minkowski sum along a segment, so `t -> phi(q - p(t))` is
CONVEX and golden section (32 iterations, interval 4.6e-9) finds the
min to far below a cell. The evaluated min is an UPPER bound of the
true distance, so removal is never over-claimed: ghost rest, the
blessed direction, never a false clean. The ball closes further into
the capsule's closed form (the ROADMAP's "exact" entry, literal).
Pose sampling was considered and refused for the same reason the
ROADMAP refuses it: not conservative, never a verdict source.
(3) Sign layering: a query on the shell (magnitude 0) lifts only by
a removal claim (`cut.max(0.0)`), and `max` of a non-positive mesh
term with a negative cut claim is the mesh term - so wherever
parity says material and the tool demonstrably did not reach, the
field says material, whatever the cell size or band width. The
`phi >= cap` store-skip leans on the same inequality: its claim
could never beat the mesh's `-cap`, so skipping is not an opinion.
(4) The flat endmill's flank is FINITE and explicit (`SdfTool::Flat
{ r, flank }`), where the dexel's column is infinite: above the
flank's ceiling the field shows rest where the column shows air
(`the_flat_sweep_says_cylinder_not_column` probes the divergence on
purpose). Chosen because the field's law only speaks through the
solid, and a solid with an infinite flank is not a tool; the
reconciliation at declared tolerance rides stage C (pass a flank
that spans the stock and the two agree to a cell). Bull-nose is
deliberately absent: it is the rounded-rect profile the ROADMAP
lists next to the torus and the frustum, and it belongs with the
lathe sweeps, not smuggled in as a half-ball.
(5) Non-finite moves REFUSE by name, where `Dexel::subtract` skips
them silently - the dexel can afford to ignore a NaN column because
a NaN column top is inert in its report; a field is a total function
and its totality is the promise. The finiteness gate runs BEFORE the
rapid skip (found at test design: a garbage rapid was sailing
through "touch nothing" - refusing malformed input at the door is
the Prime Directive's wording, and the door is now earlier). The
window refusal is atomic the same way: every chord's cell budget is
proved payable before ANY write, so a refusal never leaves half a
move subtracted (`an_unpayable_window_refuses_and_writes_nothing`
checks the field answers identically after the no).
(6) Cost: golden section per cell per chord is stage B's honesty
price - 12^3-cell law tests run in seconds, real programs will not.
The ROADMAP's economy (marching the envelope's dirty bricks once,
eikonal re-normalization, GPU scan conversion) is stage C's, and
this stage keeps the seam so small that C can trade the walk for a
sweep without a single verdict call site moving.

Test-shape note: the law suites probe CELL CENTERS and assert
`after == max(before, (-phi).min(cap))` with `phi` from formulas the
tests write independently (capsule closed form; dense parameter
scans against the field's golden section; the cone as a half-plane
triangle - its nearest surface point provably rides the query's own
half-plane). The arc test measures the sagitta contract instead:
chord sweep vs true arc sweep, within the tolerance the chords were
built under.

## M7.1 C - the seam and the marched height: seven decisions the parity law rests on (2026-11-05)

**Chosen: `Stock` becomes a two-armed enum (`Column(Dexel) |
Field(SdfField)`) behind the identical verdict API, and the field arm's
column heights come from a sphere-trace march whose bracket is read at
a per-cell RAY-ENTRY layer (`cut_ups`, `field_ray`).** Considered and
dropped, decision by decision.

(1) **The seam's shape.** A `dyn StockBackend` trait object was
considered for the dual engine and dropped: components are
Rust-owned types under the current schema policy, the enum is the same
dispatch without the indirection, and every call site (deviate,
measure, the viewer's sheet, `surface_z`) already crosses one function
- which arm answers is the enum's one opinion. Verdict law stays a
copy of the column engine's, line for line: the parity law of stage C
is that a verdict does not learn which arm read it. `tol` rides
measure exactly as the column takes it (no `max(0)`, no gate); a NaN
column means NO verdict, never a zero - `Unreadable` and `NoMaterial`
join air in that rule.

(2) **The height law - the crux.** A per-cell scalar cannot position
a sub-cell surface, and four cheap rules were analyzed against the
parity fixtures before one was trusted:
- *bisection on point-signal sign flips*: exact for mesh-driven
  flips, but a cut-driven flip (a flank crossing inside a cell whose
  centers are both air-side in magnitude) converges to the CELL
  BOUNDARY - the cone fixture's flank columns answered 4.0 where the
  truth is 3+d=3.707, a hidden gouge of 0.29 (the worst direction) and
  an `is_clean` verdict that FLIPS against the column. Refused.
- *center interpolation* (lateral |phi| as vertical lift): invalid at
  rim columns, where the nearest solid point is lateral, not above -
  it phantom-removed the pocket's rim wall (broke 7 parity tests
  when tried). Refused.
- *one-step* (`cm + |phi(center)|`): exact-ward for curved cuts but
  the same rim lie in smaller clothing (4.621 where the answer is
  5.0; broke 5 parity tests). Refused.
- *max(half-cell, |phi|)*: planars exact, cone flank still flips to
  clean whenever |phi| < half-cell. Refused - a rule that changes an
  `is_clean` verdict by which arm applies it is the Prime Directive's
  silent wrong answer.
Chosen instead: **the cut layer carries a companion, not a
replacement**. Per claimed cell, `field_ray` stores the distance UP
the vertical ray from the cell center to the first PROVEN-inside point
of the swept solid (NaN when the ray never meets it inside the cell).
A swept solid is a Minkowski sum of a segment and a convex profile, so
its intersection with the vertical line is ONE interval - the entry is
a 1-D convex root, found by golden section then bisection KEEPING THE
INSIDE SIDE, which makes it a LOWER bound of the true crossing: the
layer can only report material below the truth (ghost rest, the
blessed direction), never above it. The march's bracket reads that
entry where the column's flip was cut-driven, the cell boundary where
it was mesh-driven (the mesh's planes, exact), and half a cell
otherwise. Merged across moves by MIN - the union of removals upward
along a ray, the dual of the cut layer's running max; both commute,
so replay stays order-independent. Mesh-only walks (the uncut stock
top, the column's pre-program height) pass `cuts=false` and never see
the layer. This OVERTURNS the earlier decision of this stage to defer
`cut_ups` to M7.3: the deferral presumed a verdict-neutral addition,
and the flank analysis shows the opposite - without it the field arm
would judge `is_clean` differently from the column, and a deferred
decision that flips a safety verdict is not deferred, it is refused.

(3) **Where the two arms may differ, and why those are blessed.** The
flat endmill's FINITE flank (stage B's `SdfTool::Flat`) shows rest
above its ceiling where the column's infinite cylinder shows air, and
the truncated cone shows rest above its max-radius disc where the
column's cone equation cuts a chimney forever; both divergences are
rest OVER-reported, never removal, and both are probed by name
(`the_flat_sweep_says_cylinder_not_column` and the cone's fixture
checks). The reconciliation the ROADMAP asked for: a flank tall
enough to span the stock agrees with the column to one cell - i.e.
every divergence is bounded by a geometric fact a user can read off
the tool definition, and the parity suite's other 11 tests are
tolerance-free or solver-floor-free agreements.

(4) **The residue is stated, not smoothed.** The march's heights carry
a solver floor (~1e-7 per column: golden-section and bisection
endpoint residuals), NOT a cell; the single-height parity assertions
read 1e-5 and the summed-volume ones 1e-5 too (a dozen floor errors
add up, and a 1e-6 assert was the floor speaking, not the law). Cone
gouge counts are asserted EXACT (twelve bitten columns, the d=2.121
corners standing untouched past the cone's own reach) - a count is
where a floor error would have to cross a threshold, and none does.
Honest numbers in the ledger beat tuned numbers in the fixtures.

(5) **Window dilation is per-axis.** The first C-day law dilated a
chord's AABB by the solid's BOUNDING radius in every axis, which
refused a spanning vertical flank as absurd (r=3, flank=60 -> a
cube 126 cells tall in a stock 5 tall). Chosen: dilate each world
axis by that axis's own reach (`lateral + axial*|a_u| + cap + cell`),
and keep the refusal ceiling as an atomic PRE-scan over all chords
before any write, so an absurd move still refuses with the field
untouched.

(6) **Refusals are parity too.** A non-finite tolerance, a grid past
`MAX_CELLS_PER_AXIS`, a non-finite move: both arms name it, the same
words where they can share them. The field adds only the window
refusal, and `field subtract`'s input gates run BEFORE the rapid skip
(the B lesson: garbage rapids sailing through "touch nothing").
`surface_z` on an empty footprint is the empty verdict, not an error,
in both arms.

(7) **The seam lives in sim.** M7.1 C ships the dual engines and the
marched verdicts INSIDE `camcraft-sim`; app, motion and the viewport
keep calling the same functions and stay on the column until their
own stages flip them: the 3D view wants a traced mesh (M7.2), the
gouge checker's per-triangle distances ride the retirement (M7.3),
and `Backend` selection is explicit (a parameter, not a global) so no
call site can be surprised mid-release. The 400-line law shaped the
file layout, not the design: `march.rs` keeps the descent and its
bracket, `march_verdicts.rs` the three consumers, `field_ray.rs` the
entry law - each file one concern of the march.

## M7.2 A - the march's eye: six decisions the preview law rests on (2026-11-05)

**Chosen: a CPU sphere-trace preview INSIDE `camcraft-sim`
(`stock_sim::preview`), marched over a trilinear blend of the stock's
own lattice, classed per pixel by the TARGET's exact distance at the
hit point, reached through `Stock::preview` on the field arm only.**
The viewport pass (M7.2 B) will trace the same laws on the GPU; this
stage is the law, its parity against the verdicts, and the never-
black-screen fallback. Considered and dropped, decision by decision.

(1) **Field arm only, refusing by name.** The column's
`Stock::distance` is the VERTICAL distance to a flat top - a lateral
ray marched on it would slip past walls that are not vertical
metaphors. Giving the column arm an axis-aligned fake (marching its
height field as a box union) was considered and refused: it would
paint a volume the engine cannot defend, and the sheet already shows
that arm honestly. So `preview` answers `Invalid("... needs the field
arm")` - the retirement (M7.3) is where the sheet loses its job, not
here.

(2) **The marched field is the blended lattice, not the stored
scalar.** Hart's step law needs a LOWER bound of true clearance; the
field's per-cell value is quantized (two centers straddling a plane
each store half a cell), and tracing it raw makes rays ORBIT cell-
boundary planes forever - never landing, always budget-exhausting.
Chosen: trilinear blend of the eight corner values (mesh layer signed
by each corner's own cached column parity, cut layer interpolated
with its no-claim floor held at -4 cap), and the step spends 0.9 of
the certified radius (RELAX): relaxation can only fall short of the
surface, never past it, so convergence is bought at 10% of the steps.
The AABB gap jump stays UNrelaxed - it is exact, not interpolated.
Bisecting the lattice instead was dropped: a blend of near-exact
BFS/cut samples is already within the lattice's own slack, and a
bracket needs a proven-negative endpoint the bound step does not
hand it for free.

(3) **Hit validation is a MATERIAL-BEHIND probe, not a live sign.**
The first cut at this checked the raw `distance(p)` sign at the
candidate - and the parity law makes that wrong exactly where it
matters: crossings count STRICTLY above the probe's z, so a hit
standing on a lattice plane reads air and an honest surface pixel
would loop to `Unreadable`. Chosen instead: the candidate stands iff
material proves at `p` or one cell DEEPER along the ray (the same
climb-to-topmost-material law `march` answers heights by); a phantom
- blend grazing zero inside an air pocket - creeps a few eps and
marches on. What this law can still thread is a wall thinner than one
cell, silently and at the budget's edge; the field header already
names that exception, and the VERDICT paths stay exact-parity truth.
A preview is a picture.

(4) **The class oracle is the target's EXACT distance.** The hit
point's deviation asks `true_distance` (the point-triangle kernel)
and `inside` (ray parity) of the MODEL's field - not its lattice:
the model never carries cuts, so quantizing it would add a half-cell
lie the verdict has no reason to make. The gate is `tol + 0.15 cell`:
widening only moves borderline pixels toward CLEAN, never across a
gouge accusation. The cheap lattice read was dropped for this reason
alone - it would have named gouge on the model's own surface at
columns a raw lattice call already refuses to round.

(5) **The render-side acceleration, promised by the field header, is
the column-parity cache.** One `shell_crossings` scan per XY column
per frame (a HashMap, `get` not `clone` in the hot loop); samples
wear their column's cached crossings, which is exactly the
acceleration `field.rs` deferred to "the render stage". The
per-sample live scan (the verdict march's own law) was kept as the
oracle in the header's text and refused in the hot loop: 64 steps x
8 corners x a facet list per pixel is not a fallback, it is a stall.

(6) **The frame's honesty, and its shape.** No-verdict pixels carry
NaN depth and class 3 - the `color_classes` law extended to pixels,
never a zero dressed as a clean bill of health; budget exhaustion
counts itself in `Preview::unresolved`, which is the status line's
"this is a fallback", not a render artifact. `Preview` is three flat
buffers (depth f64, class f32, shade f32) because M7.2 B uploads
exactly these; the seam test compares them BITWISE (NaNs on both
sides of a sky row are equal as bits, and `==` on NaN is the one lie
a test could tell about them). The 400-line law split the module the
same way M7.1 C split the march: `preview.rs` keeps the camera, the
frame and the class law; `preview/march.rs` the Eye, the trace and
the shading - each file one concern of the eye.

## M7.2 B2 - the GPU eye: five decisions the compute pass rests on (2026-11-05)

(1) **The field ships to the GPU as a dense lattice, not as bricks.**
`preview::pack` flattens the field's own per-cell scalars - the
signed band magnitude wearing its column's parity, and the clamped
cut layer (`-4 cap` where no tool claimed the cell) - into two f32
layers over the shell's AABB plus a margin of `cap + 2` cells (the
band's horizon, so a clamped border texel answers exactly what the
march's unallocated-brick path answers). One documented rounding:
f64 to f32 texels. The brick map with an HDDA walk was dropped for
this stage: the dense pack is one trilinear read per sample in WGSL
and needs no hash on the GPU; the brick walk is the cost-law's job
(M7.3), not the picture's. A pack past `MAX_TEXELS` (8M texels,
32 MB a layer) answers `None` - the caller keeps the CPU march.

(2) **One march, two eyes, and a parity suite holding them to it.**
`trace.wgsl` ports `march.rs` term for term - the ray law
(`PreviewCamera::ray_dir`), the z-x-y blend of each layer then the
max, the hit-at-or-one-cell-deeper law, the creep, the relaxed step
with the exact AABB gap jump, the gradient-plus-AO shade - and each
constant names its Rust twin. `TracePass::trace` returns the sim's
own `Preview`, so no consumer can tell which eye answered.
`tests/trace_parity.rs` runs on the fallback adapter (WARP on
Windows) and demands >= 99% hit-mask and depth (0.1 mm) agreement,
>= 97% class agreement, and the centre rays exactly; it skips with
a note only where no adapter exists (the `gpu_render` precedent).

(3) **The one stated difference: the GPU classes by the target's
lattice.** The CPU eye asks the model's exact facet distance; a
facet scan per pixel is not a GPU budget. `pack_target` packs the
model's signed band, which is exact near the surface and answers
`cap` with the right sign beyond it, judged by the same gate
(`gate_tol` is now one function both eyes call, as is `step_eps`).
The sliver of disagreement sits at class borders - measured by the
parity suite, not assumed away.

(4) **Status, not NaN, on the wire.** WGSL has no portable NaN, so
the kernel writes per pixel (depth, class, shade, status: empty /
hit / unreadable) and the host turns status into the NaN-depth,
class-3, `unresolved` law - the frame stays honest on both sides of
the bus.

(5) **Refusal is the fallback's doorbell.** `TracePass::new` builds
the kernel inside a validation error scope; a device that cannot
compute-shade, a lattice past the storage binding limit, a malformed
pack, a frame past the CPU path's own caps - each answers `Err` by
name and the viewport falls back to the CPU march (stage B3). The
first gate caught the one way this law can bite: `target` is a
reserved WGSL word, and the kernel never compiled - which the Err
path reported by name instead of crashing.

## M10.1 A+D - the tool law's table: seven decisions (2026-11-05)

Built by a parallel worktree agent, reviewed and committed by the main
session.

(1) **The sets live in their own module** (`operation/tool_law.rs`),
named constants each row points at, with each set's reasoning beside
it. `kinds.rs` was already far past the 400-line law (~2.2k) and grows
only by one line a row. Dropped: a per-OpType match function (a second
truth beside the registry), and splitting `kinds.rs` now (its own
refactor, not this stage's).

(2) **3D Finish and every multi-axis kind take BallNose only.** The
ROADMAP's "waterline-class tangent laws still preferring round noses"
could read as admitting BullNose; the narrower set matches what those
generators accept at their doors today, so the ribbon will never light
for a tool that cannot pass. Dropped: all three mill forms with the
generator filtering - an offer that always refuses is the silent lie
in UI form.

(3) **The flat-floor 2D kinds take EndMill + BullNose, not BallNose.**
The bull nose is the everyday flat-floor roughing form; a ball
contradicts the flat floor the kind promises. Dropped: EndMill alone
(too narrow for shop practice).

(4) **Trace and Engrave take all four mill forms, the cone included**
- centerline cuts with the tangency laws stood down; the V-bit is the
engraver.

(5) **The milled Thread takes Tap only** - the thread-mill cylinder is
modeled as a Tap because only Tap carries the pitch the ride is timed
by. Dropped: EndMill (no pitch: it would fail the generator's door
every time).

(6) **The milled Bore takes the flat mills, not the boring bar** - it
is an interpolated ride, not a G86-class cycle; the bar belongs to the
Drill row's bore cycle and to turned boring.

(7) **Drill is one row taking Drill, Tap and Bore** - the registry is
per operation kind, not per cycle; matching the chosen cycle to the
tool stays the drilling crate's door. Spot is never automatic (M1.6),
and no spot-specific ToolKind exists to claim. Stage B's heads-up: any
existing fixture pairing a kind with a tool outside this table (a ball
on a 2D Contour or Face) will start refusing once `CreateOperation`
gates - sweep the fixtures first.

## M7.2 B3a - the field program sim the eye draws: three decisions (2026-11-05)

(1) **One plan, two engines.** `simulate_document`'s op planning is
extracted verbatim into `stock_sim::plan_program` + `part_facets`; the
column verdict and `stock_view::field_view` walk the same plan, so the
eye can never draw a different program than the verdict judged.
`stock_sim_document` and `posting` guard the refactor.

(2) **A display field, sized for the frame, with the true stock.** The
verdict field's `block_field` reaches ten spans down to mimic a
semi-infinite column; the eye builds the stock ENTITY's own mesh at its
placement (the block the machine holds), at a cell of
`max(auto_cell, cbrt(volume / (MAX_TEXELS/4)))` so the dense pack fits
its budget. The mesh is uniformly 4-way subdivided until no edge spans
more than 32 cells - shared edges split at the same midpoint, so a
watertight shell stays watertight, and every facet stays inside the
field builder's per-facet candidate limit. The verdict (status line,
post gate) stays on the column engine until M7.3; this field is the
picture.

(3) **Refusals by name; the target may be absent.** A rotated stock
and a multi-setup program (the flip transform is not the eye's to
guess) refuse, and the viewport keeps its sheet. A model the field
cannot sign (an open shell) leaves `target` empty with its reason, and
those pixels paint class 3 - unjudged, never clean.

## M11.1 A - facing turn blends: six decisions (2026-11-05)

Built by a parallel worktree agent, reviewed and committed by the main
session.

(1) **The arc keeps the step's endpoints and bulges OUTWARD into the
overrun.** A U-turn of radius stride/2, centered on the step line, one
G2/G3 block per reversal - the rows are untouched, so the footprint is
cut exactly as by the sharp path. Dropped: the inward arc (rows stopped
short so the arc stays inside the straight sweep) - the facing
verifier's boundary law demands every move endpoint stand a tool
radius off the footprint, read the shortened rows as gouges on every
move and would have blocked the post. The outward reach is bounded by
the blend radius, which is capped at the tool radius, lies outside the
part's footprint by construction, and is judged by the existing verify
and machine gates (fixtures, travel) like any other overrun move.

(2) **Opt-in, off by default** (`blend_turns`): the precedent that a
new choice cannot disturb a path that never asks for it, and the golden
discipline - every existing .cl/.nc golden re-ran byte-identical. One
new byte witness (`face_square_40x40_blended.cl`, same 11 moves, four
steps become arcs). Flipping the draft default to on is a user decision
left open.

(3) **Radius = stride/2, legal only within [0.01 mm, tool radius]**: a
semicircle is the only single arc joining two parallel rows; the floor
keeps micron-snapped centers clear of controller endpoint checks.
Dropped: quarter arcs with a straight middle (more than one move per
turn).

(4) **A refused turn stays sharp and says so** - counted per reason
once per path in the toolpath notes the status line shows, never
repeated per level.

(5) **No PROJECT_VERSION bump**: the key is absent when off (the
`tilt` precedent); the cache stamp grows one byte only when on, so old
caches stay fresh.

(6) **Follow-ups named, not done**: contour-corner blends (there the op
tolerance bounds the radius and an inside corner leaves rest the sim
must report), between-pass link blends (pocket/slot/raster
connectors), arc entry (stage B), and adding the blended fixture to the
five-post conformance set.

(4) **The display cut: the flat tool's flank sized to the stock, not
the verdict world** (`Stock::simulate_display`, sim
`stock_sim/display.rs`). The first gate run measured the cost of
`spanning_flank` on the eye's field: the cut window grows by the
tool's bounding radius on every axis, so a ~105 mm flank made a 60 mm
facing program take minutes in debug (one fixture ran 14 min before it
was stopped). A flank from the lowest tip to the stock's ceiling plus
the band removes exactly the same material inside the stock's box -
every cell within the radius above a tip lies below the ceiling - and a
unit test holds the two cuts to the same sign everywhere in the box and
the same value wherever a surface is resolved. Posed (multi-axis)
moves keep the spanning law. The verdict path keeps `simulate`
untouched; the general per-brick cost law is still M7.3's. Display
budget default lowered to MAX_TEXELS/32; the fixtures use a coarse
`field_view_with` budget because they test wiring and classes, not
resolution.

## M7.2 B3b - the traced stock in the viewport: six decisions (2026-11-05)

(1) **The field view is walked lazily, by the GPU-backed shell only**
(`actions::ensure_field_view`), not inside `toggle_deviate` as the B3
handoff planned. `field_view` costs seconds and up (tens of seconds in
debug), and every headless Deviate test would have paid it for a
picture no headless run can show. The arming still retires and resets
the view (`field_view = None` on each toggle, document switch and
open); the first shaded frame after arming walks it once and keeps the
answer or the refusal (`Option<Result<Arc<FieldView>, String>>`).
Considered: computing in `toggle_deviate` (rejected - test cost);
computing on a worker thread (deferred - it blocks the frame once per
arming today, the same synchronous law `simulate_document` already
follows; M7.2 C playback is the natural home for a background walk).

(2) **The composite reads the trace buffer as fragment storage**, a
fullscreen triangle writing `frag_depth = (mvp*hit).z/w` from the hit
rebuilt along the FRAGMENT's own ray (viewport aspect), with `t` taken
from the covering trace pixel. A device whose fragment stage binds no
storage refuses at construction and keeps the sheet, said once in the
log. Considered: copying the buffer into an Rgba32Float texture (row
pitch alignment forces a padded copy per frame; rejected as more moving
parts for no device we target).

(3) **Frames are cached, not re-marched per redraw**: the trace re-runs
only when the camera basis, the viewport extent or the field `Arc`
changes. The GPU trace budget is 2M pixels (an integer downscale `k`
past it - a 4K panel traces at half resolution); the CPU fallback
budget is 32k pixels, upsampled by the same composite.

(4) **Shading is `tint x (0.2 + 0.8 shade)`, opaque**, fs_stock's
verdict palette (steel / amber / red / gray). The 0.2 ambient floor
keeps an unlit wall readable as material instead of a hole. With no
target the whole stock is class 3 gray - honest, and the status line
names why (`target_note`).

(5) **The traced stock takes the sheet's whole slot - faces and wire -
in shaded modes only.** The sheet's feature edges would outline the
UNMACHINED block over the machined field; wireframe mode keeps the
sheet wire, since a sphere-traced surface has no wire to offer.

(6) **Refusals are said once per state**: `StockEye::prepare` answers
`Err` the first time a camera/extent/field fails and the shell appends
it to the status line; the same state is not retried every frame.
`StockEye::cpu_only` exists so the fallback is tested on purpose
(`tests/trace_composite.rs` holds GPU and CPU to the same pixel).

## M7.2 test diet - the B3a eye and pack tests made smaller, not ignored (2026-11-05)

Made the fixtures smaller instead of moving the tests to the heavy lane,
because both laws hold on smaller input. (1)
`pack::the_gate_refuses_a_huge_region_by_size_not_by_crash` now uses two
1 mm cubes 220 mm apart rather than a 1200x90x90 bar. The pack already
refused by size before allocating; the whole 48-80 s was the sparse
builder covering the bar's surface. Debug time went from ~60 s to
0.04 s, and the test now also checks the target pack (same gate). (2)
`stock_view`'s M2.3 fixture went from a 60x60 to a 20x20 footprint,
with `COARSE` scaled to the volume so the 1.53 mm cell, the heights and
the clean/gouge/rest classes are unchanged. The time was the display cut
of the Face program, which grows with area; the suite went from ~64 s
to ~16 s. Considered and dropped: `#[ignore]` on the heavy lane (neither
test measures geometry at full precision) and a coarser cell (it would
put the class gate at risk). Follow-up for M7.3: the display cut's
per-move cost is what keeps `the_eye_lands...` near 10 s even at 20x20.

## M7.2 C - progressive playback: five decisions (2026-11-05)

(1) **Playback is a prefix cut, checkpointed by whole snapshots**
(`app::stock_play::FieldPlay`). The field's subtraction is a running
max, so the stock after k moves is exactly the uncut stock minus those
k moves, cut in any grouping; the last frame of playback is
byte-for-byte the Deviate field view (the suite holds it). Backward
seek clones the nearest snapshot at or before the target, so memory is
bounded at 33 field copies (stride = max(64, moves/32)). The ROADMAP's
dirty-brick journal is the cheaper form of the same law and belongs
with M7.3's per-brick cost law. Dropped: re-cutting from move 0 on
every backward seek (too slow for a scrub), and unbounded snapshots.

(2) **Only completed moves cut.** The segment under the playhead has
not finished removing its material yet; showing it partly done would
need sub-move sweeps, which we don't do for now.

(3) **Timeline and plan meet by op name, and a connector rapid is not
a move.** The sim script is walked in tree order and the plan in
posting order. An op the plan doesn't hold is refused by name, never
silently skipped, which would leave material shown standing that the
machine removes. An op's segment span one longer than its moves
carries the connector between programs, and that connector is
discounted.

(4) **The transport arms the traced stock by itself.** With Deviate
down, playback shows unjudged material (class 3 gray): mid-program
everything would read as rest, which is true but useless. With Deviate
up it is judged. The mode key is (transport, Deviate, doc_version while
playing), so an edit during playback rebuilds the plan; Deviate alone
keeps its frozen-evidence law and does not track edits.

(5) **Each changed frame clones the stock and re-uploads its lattice.**
That is simple and correct, and costly on big programs. A per-frame
move budget and dirty-brick uploads are M7.3's cost law, recorded there
rather than half-built here.

## M10.1 B - the tool law at command creation: six decisions (2026-11-05)

(1) **"The active setup's tool list" is the document's tool library,
named after the active setup.** Tools are document-wide entities with no
per-setup ownership, so the gate reads the whole library and names
`setup::active` in the refusal. A document with no setups says "the
setup's tools", matching the browser's single Setup row. Dropped:
`tool_list::for_setup`, which is built from ops, so an empty setup
would always refuse; and a made-up `Setup1` name for the no-setup case.

(2) **CreateOperation checks the named tool; the setup-level sentence
wins when nothing fits.** An end mill on a groove op is refused even
when a blade is in the library ("'X' is a flat end mill; ... cuts with
a grooving blade"). When no tool fits at all, the refusal is the more
useful "No grooving blade in Setup1's tools". The gate runs after
`family_gate`, so the machine-family refusal still comes first.
Dropped: checking only that some fitting tool exists, which would let
the hand-test case through.

(3) **The roadmap's "ChangeTool" is two commands here.** Assigning a
tool goes through `EditOperationLinks`, gated only when the tool
actually changes, so a source-only edit on an old mismatched file
still works. Editing a tool's definition goes through `ChangeTool`,
which refuses a kind change that would strand an op and names that op;
edits that keep the kind are never gated. Dropped: gating `DeleteTool`
(that is item C's after-state).

(4) **"A tool retype through EditOperationParams" maps to
`ChangeOperationKind`.** `EditOperationParams` already refuses kind
changes, and retyping has gone through `ChangeOperationKind` since
M9.1; it now checks the new kind against the op's current tool.

(5) **Quick-add picks the newest fitting tool.** `actions::add_operation`
asks app's `fitting_tools`. When nothing fits it hands on the newest
tool, so the command refuses by name. Dropped: always taking the newest
tool, which would make a lit cell fail whenever the newest tool belongs
to another family.

(6) **Generator wrong-tool tests reach the generator by delete-and-re-add,
not through a weaker gate.** The shared helper
`create_past_the_tool_law` first asserts that the gate refuses. It then
puts the mismatched tool under the op through the ungated
delete/re-add path. All 15 generator-refusal tests keep their asserts.
Not done: `commands/operation.rs` is now ~750 lines, further over the
400-line cap (split owed); the op page's tool dropdown still lists
every tool, and a wrong pick is refused by `EditOperationLinks`.

## M7.2 D - a mesh when asked: four decisions (2026-11-05)

(1) **Marching cubes in its tetrahedral form** (`sim::stock_sim::iso`,
six tetrahedra around one main diagonal, per Bloomenthal's implicit
surface polygonizer). It needs no 256-case table, has no ambiguous
faces, and is watertight by construction; the suite checks closure
with an open-edge count. Dropped: the classic case table, which adds
more code and the face-ambiguity fixes; dual contouring, whose sharp
interior corners are the ROADMAP's "where they must survive" clause,
and no consumer needs them yet.

(2) **Samples stand on the field's cell centres.** `SdfField::distance`
is exact at cell centres and constant across each cell. The first cut
sampled on cell faces and came out a quarter cell fat (568 vs 480 on a
10x8x6 box); on the centres it lands within 5%.

(3) **A hole is a refusal.** `stock_export::machined_mesh` refuses an
extraction with any open edge rather than write an STL that claims a
solid it isn't. The mesh cache keys on the identity of the
`Arc<FieldView>`, the same view the viewport traces, so a new cut or a
re-arm is a new mesh, never a stale one. It is retired on document
switch and open.

(4) **Consumers: the STL export ships; picking and the G-code viewer
keep what they have.** The Deviate bar gains "Export STL", which goes
through the pending-command queue with a dialog arm and a headless path
arm, like the setup sheet. Picking selects entities, not surface
points, and the stock entity is still the thing picked. The G-code
viewer's 3D view already shows the traced stock through the B3b eye. So
no consumer needs the triangles there today; `MeshCache` is the seam
when one does. This is a scope call for the close-out: the ROADMAP
clause names those consumers, and here they are served by the eye,
not by triangles.

## M11.1 corners + links - tangent fillets on contour corners and pocket links: eight decisions (2026-11-05)

(1) **The fillet radius is the largest legal one, not tolerance-bound.**
rho = min(tool radius, half of each leg); the op tolerance only sets the
floor (rho >= max(tol, 0.01 mm)). The rest the rounding leaves,
rho(sec(theta/2) - 1), is allowed and stated in the notes for the stock
sim to measure. Dropped: bounding the rest by the tolerance, which
gives ~0.024 mm fillets at 90 degrees - a G2/G3 too small to change
how the machine moves.

(2) **Corners that turn toward the part are always refused.** The
offset's round joins already round those corners, and a fillet inside
such a turn would sit on the part's side of a path that already grazes
it. Refused and counted as "toward the part". Turns toward the air
round, and leave corner rest, never a gouge.

(3) **Legality is a triangle test against the cutter-centre region.**
The triangle (corner, two tangent points) contains the whole arc. A
refused radius is halved up to four times before the corner counts as
blocked. Dropped: chord-sample checks, which miss the arc's bulge
between samples.

(4) **Only line-to-line corners round.** Corners next to an arc stay
sharp and are counted, and so does a closed walk's start/end corner:
rounding it would move the plunge and lead join, which belong to the
entry law. Line-to-arc fillets are deferred.

(5) **"Between-pass links" means the pocket's straight feed links**
(zigzag row-to-link jogs) plus ring corners, since they share one walk.
Contour levels connect by lifts, not feed links, so there is nothing to
fillet there. Adaptive2D/Offset2D are hard-wired off; surfacing the
toggle there is a later call.

(6) **Open centerline runs never blend.** They have no region and no
side to prove against, which is named once in the notes.

(7) **Kinks under 0.5 degrees are tessellation noise.** They pass
through uncounted. Every number avoids transcendental calls, so the
bytes match on every platform's libm (the M4.2b lesson).

(8) **Opt-in, no format churn.** The `blend_turns` key is skipped when
false, so there is no PROJECT_VERSION bump, and the cache digest byte
0xB1 is written only when it is on. Every existing golden stays
byte-identical; two new blended `.cl` goldens are added. They are not
posted to NC goldens, matching A's facing precedent. Open: contour.rs
(~650 lines) and commands/operation.rs (~750) are past the 400-line
cap, and a seam split is owed.

## M10.1 C - the honest after-state: five decisions (2026-11-05)

(1) **BLOCKED is computed, not stored.** There is no new status value.
Generation, `posting::program_ops`, the tree and the page each ask
`tool_gate::tool_problem` against the live world, so undo or a fitting
reassignment clears it without any command writing a flag. The project
file never changes (no version bump, no migration). Dropped: a fourth
`OpStatus::Blocked`, which would have touched every match on the
status and the script API's `"ok"|"stale"|"never"` type for no gain.

(2) **The post refuses rather than skipping a blocked op.**
`program_ops` returns the sentence plus " - fix the tool before
posting", checked before never/stale, so the stock sim, the machine
check and the post all agree. Dropped: leaving the op out silently,
which would post a program missing an op the user can see. An old
file whose cached path still matches its inputs reads OK but is still
refused at the post - the tool, not the cache, is what is wrong.

(3) **Generator wrong-tool tests call the generator directly.**
`common::generate_past_the_tool_law` first asserts that
`GenerateOperation` blocks, then calls `operation::generate` (what the
command wraps), so both the gate and the generators' shape checks stay
tested. Dropped: rewriting those 16 tests to expect the gate's
sentence, which would leave the generators' refusals untested.

(4) **The "old file" fixture is built inside the test.** A pre-law file
can't be made with commands any more. The test swaps the tool for a
grooving blade under the op and re-stamps the saved JSON with what that
world produces, which is exactly what an older build wrote. Dropped: a
committed fixture file, because the stamp is a `DefaultHasher` digest
that only holds within one build.

(5) **The deleted-tool stale reason keeps its old wording**; the page's
BLOCKED line takes priority over it. The ui test went into the
~4,100-line `egui_app/tests.rs`, since it needs that file's private
harness; splitting that suite is owed.

## M12.1 stage 1 - solidcore evaluated behind a kernel seam: seven decisions (2026-11-05)

(1) **solidcore is pinned at `=1.0.1`.** It is published as 1.0.1, not
the 0.0.x the ROADMAP describes, matching the SMLib upstream release
exactly. The bench numbers only mean something against one version;
later minor versions add opt-in fixes. Dropped: a git dependency.

(2) **The seam measures instead of tessellating.** solidcore 1.0.1 has
not ported tessellation. `trait Kernel` offers `measure` (volume plus
bounding box): solidcore integrates exactly, and truck measures its own
mesh. A solidcore display path needs upstream tessellation first.

(3) **The truck side sits behind an optional `truck` feature**, turned
on only for this crate's own tests. truck-shapeops 0.4.0 forces
truck-meshalgo's default features, which pull vtkio, xz2 and lzma-sys
(C code), exactly the chain the workspace keeps out of camcraft-app.

(4) **Offset runs with `merge_results: true` plus two guards.** It
refuses insets of at least half the thinnest extent, and the volume
must move in the direction of the offset's sign. Without them, the
port's defaults return a 0-volume non-solid for a box inset by 1, and
a box inset by 6 comes back as a valid-looking volume-8 solid: a wrong
answer dressed as right. The guards only see the overall extent, so a
thin wall in a big part could still collapse unseen; a per-feature
check is stage-2 work.

(5) **Port findings are pinned in a table, not failing tests.**
`KNOWN_PORT_VERDICTS` records the port's behaviour on a NaN offset, a
NaN origin, an empty-shape offset, and the inset-by-1 and inset-by-6
cases. Each is wrapped into an `Err` by our side, and a version bump
that changes any of them fails the test. They should be filed upstream
at tangency-labs/solidcore. solidcore never panicked; truck's known
panics are contained the way `geometry::import::step` already does it.

(6) **Agreement verdict: the boolean and offset fixtures agree.**
solidcore is within 1e-6 of the analytic volume, truck is within its
mesh budget, and truck converges toward solidcore at finer tessellation.
Bounding boxes match within 1e-14. Remaining before truck can retire:
fillet fixtures, the corrupt-input corpus through a solidcore importer
(none exists - STEP stays on truck-stepio per the ROADMAP), and adding
the crate to M4.2's wasm CI job. `cargo check --target
wasm32-unknown-unknown` already passes locally.

(7) **Cost noted.** The crate is ~607k lines and takes 7-8 minutes per
profile to compile; nothing outside `camcraft-kernel` depends on it
yet, so the app's debug ladder doesn't pay that. Truck's own Apache-2.0
notice is still missing from `assets/ui/LICENSES.md` and is owed in its
own commit.

## M11.1 B - the arc entry (circular ramp): seven decisions (2026-11-05)

(1) **Emitted as a chord fan, not a G18/G19 arc.** The CL `ArcMove` is
XY-only (a Z change along it is a helix) and no post states a plane
word, so a vertical-plane arc posts as G1 chords. Their sagitta stays
within the op's tolerance, or `ARC_FIT_TOL` (0.01 mm) where the op has
none, capped at 4096 chords and refused by name past that. Dropped:
adding a plane field to `ArcMove` plus G17/G18/G19 to every post (it
touches every CL reader and every post golden - its own decision); a
single straight chord (that is just the ramp).

(2) **No new radius parameter.** The arc asks for the tool diameter
first and halves toward the drop h, never below it (R >= h keeps the
sweep at most 90 degrees with no vertical leg). The lead room is what
bounds the radius. Dropped: reusing `helix_radius` (wrong meaning,
validated <= tool radius) and a new `arc_radius` on 9 parameter
variants (wire, stamp and UI churn for a number the room decides).

(3) **Legality is the ramp's chord law, unchanged.** The arc's XY
footprint is the lead chord and its Z stays between the two planes, so
the ramp's one-chord test certifies it. The start height is the ramp's
start (the previous cut plane, or clearance on the first level). The
fallback is the ramp's `substituted_dive`, with the reason named.

(4) **The 3-D shell substitutes, named.** No proof follows the fan
onto lifted shell tips; the rest ladder keeps the vertical dive, as
Ramp and Helix do.

(5) **No PROJECT_VERSION bump.** `EntryDto::Arc` is appended; an older
build reading an `"arc"` file refuses it as Corrupt (unknown variant),
never misreads it. Tension noted: M2.5 A/B did bump for new grammar
words; this follows the opt-in/append law instead. Stamp byte 3 is
appended, so no existing op goes Stale.

(6) **Zigzag pockets always fall back, by geometry.** Each row starts
on the region boundary, so there is no lead room behind the first cut,
and the note says so. Circular rings after the first have no drop.
Dropped: re-seating the pass start, which changes the plan and the
existing goldens.

(7) **Found while building it: a suspected lead-in gouge.** An inside
contour with an arc LEAD-IN at a corner start places the lead start
outside the tool-radius inset. The arc entry refuses to start from
there. The lead-in itself is a separate Prime Directive investigation,
logged in its own entry.

## User review 2026-11-05 - two calls overturned by hand-test

- **M9.1 B's stacked pane is reversed: the operation page gets its tabs
  back.** The user, hand-testing: "the tabs in the operations menu are
  gone so everything is just a lot to scroll thru - no organization,
  hard to read and hard to understand." The M9.1 B rationale (no dead
  tabs, the whole truth in one scroll) loses to readability. The
  restoration keeps M9.1 A's retype-on-row and the no-dead-tabs law.
- **M11.1 B's "bores first" arc entry is not enough.** On an outside
  contour the entry refused ("the arc needs bounded air only a bore
  has") and plunged, and the level-to-level transitions looked broken
  in the viewport. Rework in flight: an arc entry in the air beside an
  outside wall, and a clean lead-out/link/entry sequence per level.

## Contour lead room - a Prime Directive fix: five decisions (2026-11-05)

(1) **The bug was real.** Contour leads were always built at the ring's
start vertex with no room check. On an inset ring every vertex is a
corner, where no lead fits, so the lead put the cutter up to a tool
radius into the wall. The app's verifier caught it and the post
refused, so it was never silent on the app path. Direct `contour()`
callers got it with no warning, though, and four committed CL goldens
encoded it (mm-scale in the plate hole; 74 um on a bore lead-out tilted
by a short-chord end tangent).

(2) **The lead room law.** Every lead is sampled every 20 um against the
cutter-centre region the walk was planned in, with 5 um slack (half the
verifier's gouge budget). Chosen over trusting the verifier as the
backstop, which catches it only at post time.

(3) **The fallback order.** Keep the start if any halving of the lead
fits (fewest changed goldens); else move the start to a long-edge
midpoint with the largest lead first; else shrink per end; else refuse
by name in the notes. Tabbed levels never move the start, since tab
positions are measured from it, so they only shrink or refuse.

(4) **Goldens that encoded a gouge are regenerated, not preserved.** 4
CL and 15 NC goldens. A golden that encodes a gouge is itself a finding.

(5) **Follow-ups.** Use the ring's true circle tangent at the lead-out
(so a bore lead keeps its full size); stop tab-window leads nibbling
the tab; account for fit tolerance adding to the gouge budget
(10.35 um seen); split contour.rs under 400 lines.

## M7.3 A - both engines side by side, and the cost law: six decisions (2026-11-05)

(1) **Agreement fixtures are the goldens' own bytes.** The heavy suite
replays the committed `.cl` files (a reader in tests/common). The 3D
finishes are judged against their generator meshes. The 2D and drilling
goldens have no part, so they are judged against two probe plates (the
deepest tip, and halfway up so both rest and gouge show). Dropped:
re-running the generators (it duplicates golden_cl's parameters) and
synthesising intended parts (a second source of truth). Result: 35
program/part pairs agree, worst column difference 1.3e-12.

(2) **The declared epsilon is `FIELD_VERDICT_EPS = 1e-5` mm of column
height.** Agreement means every column within epsilon, every verdict
word equal, identical counts, and identical abstentions.

(3) **The verdict path's ball nose gets a shank (`SdfTool::Shanked`).**
The waterline-cone golden showed a bare sphere leaving the stock above
a deep ball pass floating: a 20.4 mm disagreement in 4030 columns. The
column engine's ball atom clears everything above the ball. Dropped:
loosening the tolerance, or calling it a blessed divergence. Follow-up:
the display cut (`simulate_display`) still uses the bare sphere.

(4) **The refusal ceiling counts the clipped window.** The old ceiling
refused face, slot and contour goldens the column engine runs, which
broke backend-independent refusals. Block stock is now a tessellated
shell (`box_shell`), because a ten-span side as one quad was over the
per-facet seed limit.

(5) **Cost law: every skip is a proof.** Clip to the region where a cut
can change an answer; one distance check per brick decides skip or
fill; full cells are final; batch per brick (exact, since max and min
commute; a test holds batched == per-move bit for bit). The upright
flat-tool fast path is nudged up by ~1e-12 so a tie never counts as
removed. Result: 70-1400x cheaper per move (contour_disc_hole 12 s ->
13 ms), and face_square, refused before, now runs.

(6) **Owed.** The ten-span-deep verdict block costs 5-48 s per build in
release, which now dominates both heavy suites; field_cut.rs and
backend.rs sit at ~405 lines, field.rs at 447; switching the display
cut to the shanked ball is a follow-up. Bullet 3 of M7.3 (retiring the
column engine) is next.

## Contour leads/links rework from the user's hand-test: five decisions (2026-11-05)

(1) **Outside-wall Arc entry is proved with `lead_fit`'s room check.**
The arc is tangent to the lead-in's first move, and its footprint is
sampled against the part's cutter-centre offset; uncut stock outside
the part may be cut. Where no arc fits: "no arc fits beside the wall
at the lead-in (x, y) ... grazing dive there instead". Tabbed levels
stand down by name, since a standing tab is invisible to the room
check. Dropped: one full-depth arc from Top (long air arcs), and
rapiding down to the level above (could hit uncut stock).

(2) **The stacked loops were seam crossings.** The tangential lead-in
and lead-out closed into a full loop at a seam vertex where the start
and end tangents differ. The lead-out is re-solved to close on the
lead-in's plunge point, which keeps G1 at both wall joints. Dropped: a
shared mean tangent, which breaks the G1 landing law. The
contour_tangential_lead golden encoded the crossing and is
regenerated.

(3) **The status-line level count uses flat feed moves only.** Lifts
and arc-entry chords no longer inflate it (the user's "8 levels" was
7).

(4) **Superseded by the user (2026-11-05): the stay-down link must be a
choice.** The rework hard-wired "stay down where one ring per level and
the link is legal, else retract". The user: "The stay down and ramp
should be an option for the user to pick not to be 'premade'.. the
whole idea of a CAM package is for the user to be able to control and
generate G-code in the end." A `level_link` parameter (default
Retract & re-enter; Stay down & ramp at a user ramp angle, named
fallback) is in flight with the gouge fix below.

(5) **Found: a SILENT gouge, top priority.** A 2D Contour whose source
is a whole model sections it once at Top and walks every ring at every
level. On the user's part the blind bore's ring cuts an annulus under
the bore floor (Z 0 down to -7), and verify checks Contour against
the same flat region, so the post lets it through. Fix in flight:
depth-aware verify for 2D ops with a model source, and per-ring level
ranges ending at each feature's floor.

## The silent blind-floor gouge, and the level link as a user choice: six decisions (2026-11-05)

(1) **2D ops on a part source are verified against the part solid.**
Contour, Face and part-picked pockets get the section law plus a new
along-the-move check (`sim::verify::solid`, the cutter centre sampled
inside the part along each move; a straight move was only checked at
its ends). Drill (Z holes), Bore and Thread get the along-the-move
check alone, because their exact hole rims would be convicted against
the faceted mesh wall. Gated on `GenJob.part_solid` (a model or picks
on models, never the stock). Left out on purpose: pocket-family ops on
a whole model (the region IS the material), Slot and Circular
(authored geometry), and Trace/Engrave/Chamfer (they cut the part by
design). Those can still pass a below-floor cut silently; owed.

(2) **A contour ring walks only down to its wall's floor.** Each ring's
levels are tested against the part section at that height and every
mesh vertex height up to the level above. A ring stops at its first
illegal level, and the floor gets its own level (vertex height plus
stock to leave), each drop named in the notes. Dropped: re-sectioning
at every level, which would follow drafts and flanges and is no longer
a 2D contour.

(3) **When every ring cuts into the part at its first level,
generation refuses.** This reverses two old fixtures: an explicit
Outside on a picked bore, and Inside on a top-face edge, which each
put the cutter in the part. Dropped: an empty path that reads as
clean.

(4) **`level_link` is the user's choice** (the user: "the whole idea of
a CAM package is for the user to be able to control and generate
G-code"). RetractReenter (default, every golden byte-identical) or
StayDownRamp at `ramp_angle` (default 3 degrees), which cuts ring by
ring and ramps down along the ring itself, so it never leaves proven
ground. It falls back to retract by name on tabbed levels or rings too
short for the angle. Shown on the Leads & Links tab as "Level to
level" and "Ramp angle (deg)". The project key is written only when not
the default, so there is no version bump; the stamp byte 0xC1 is
appended only under StayDownRamp.

(5) **The demo snapshots changed for a true reason.** The demo
Contour's status now names a shank/holder collision with the part
instead of "the uncut stock": the depth-aware law sees the shank really
rubbing the finished wall.

(6) **Owed.** contour.rs is ~690 lines (split due); depth-aware verify
for the left-out kinds; no UI-level test drives the new combo.

## M11.2 A - the arc plane in the CL and the posts: five decisions (2026-11-05)

(1) **`ArcPlane` on `ArcMove`; the centre is the centre-word pair.**
(X,Y) for I/J, (X,Z) for I/K, (Y,Z) for J/K. `ccw` means G3 by RS-274's
view-from-the-positive-normal rule in every plane, so G18 arcs read
reversed on an X-right/Z-up drawing. All arc maths runs in an in-plane
frame that is the identity for XY, so every XY arc computes exactly as
before. Chosen over a 3-D centre or a separate vertical-arc type: the
existing code and formats stay byte-identical, and the pairs map
one-to-one onto I/J/K.

(2) **Vertical arcs are split at their highest and lowest points**, so
each piece stays between its endpoint heights and the verify laws
that check endpoint heights stay honest without per-law arc
knowledge.

(3) **Spelling.** The centre letters name the plane in the CL dump and
the stream; the project file adds a `plane` key only for vertical
arcs. No version bumps.

(4) **Modal plane words in the G-code posts** (Fanuc, Haas, 840D,
Mazak). The plane word goes in the arc's block, only when the plane
changes; G17 is restored before an XY arc, before any canned cycle (or
the cycle drills along the wrong axis), and at section end. Dropped:
restating G17 in the preamble, which would change every golden.

(5) **Heidenhain posts vertical arcs as 1 um chord fans.** Its working
plane is bound to the tool-call spindle axis, so a free G18 could
reinterpret the tool axis. Dropped: refusing the program, which would
block every Heidenhain program once M11.2 B adds vertical entries.

## M11.3 A - heights from the selection: five decisions (2026-11-05)

(1) **Two variants, one combo entry.** `TopOfSelection` and
`BottomOfSelection`, matching the stock/model Top/Bottom pairs, keep
the resolver independent of which height slot asks. The UI offers one
"Selection" entry, and the row decides the end (Bottom rows store the
lowest Z; Clearance, Retract and Top store the highest). Dropped: one
slot-dependent variant, because the stamp, setup sheet and echo don't
know their slot.

(2) **What the selection spans.** A picked face: its boundary loops. A
welded wall: every strip face. An edge chain: its points. A whole
model: its world bounding box. A stock source resolves to the stock
box rather than refusing, so switching an op's source never leaves its
heights unusable (it goes Stale instead).

(3) **Never a silent 0.** An empty or vanished selection refuses by
name at create, edit, retype, re-pick, source change and generation.
Re-picking or moving the picked part makes the op Stale; undo restores
Ok.

(4) **Format.** `top_of_selection` / `bottom_of_selection` are appended
words with no version bump; stamp tags 6 and 7 appear only when used,
so no existing op's stamp changes.

(5) **Owed.** The "retract above clearance" notes outside the Heights
section show nothing for Selection heights (never a wrong number);
heights.rs is ~400 lines.

## M11.4 A+B - one region whatever was picked; optimal load in % of D: six decisions (2026-11-05)

(1) **Measured first: the pick type was not swapping generators.** On
the user's bore, every pick (floor face, rim chains, wall patch, pairs)
gave byte-identical CL under Adaptive/Zigzag/Auto. The circles come
from what 2D Adaptive is today: `waterline_passes`, offset rings
stepped by the engagement law. That is the reopened M2.4 spec, owed in
M11.4 C. Only Auto swaps by shape (`ring_is_circular`), by design.

(2) **Islands come from the part at each cut level.** Part-picked
pockets take the enclosed area minus the material standing in it
(`slice::material_above`, the verifier's own section law). This fixes
the real face-vs-edge gap (a rim pick cut through a boss the face pick
avoided) and stops through-holes in a floor being treated as islands.
New named refusals: a Bottom below the selected floor, and a pick that
encloses only part material.

(3) **`canon_ring` mirror fix.** The mirrored walk is now actually
checked, so reversed duplicate rings dedupe instead of relying on
`Region::new`'s union.

(4) **The M11.5 seam.** `AreaControls` with `apply_area_controls`
(identity today) is the one place every region passes through last:
selection regions, source-built regions (Face included) and the
Contour selection arm.

(5) **Optimal load is % of D, the angle derived.** ae = load x D, angle
= acos(1 - 2*ae/D), the straight-wall radial-engagement geometry of
peripheral milling. It is stored as the ratio and shown as a percentage
with the angle as a hint. The default (1 - cos 45)/2 = 14.6447% is
bit-exact to the old 45 degrees (11 diameters x 900 angles tested).
Legacy `max_engagement` is read and converted exactly; there is no
version bump; old Adaptive ops go Stale once and regenerate identical.

(6) **Open, for the user.** A Pocket whose source is the whole model
clears the part's own section silently - the documented "a whole-model
source is the volume to remove" contract. Kept for now; flagged.

## M7.3 B - consumer parity for the column retirement (blocked, not done): four decisions (2026-11-05)

(1) **Retirement is blocked, honestly.** Every consumer the field can
answer today is proven identical on the heavy lane: verdict, Deviate
sheet and classes, rest masks (`above(z)`) and the feed-engagement
sampler, across all 21 goldens. The deletion still waits on three
things: the field building the op-frame stock `sim_of` uses (lattice
on the footprint's own corner, plus the stock and part raise), the
multi-setup clip, and `ladder.rs`/`entry.rs` taking `&Stock`.

(2) **One shared column reader (`Stock::columns`) on both engines.**
Dropped: a per-engine sampler, a second copy of the law that could
drift.

(3) **Masks are strict thresholds, so floors are exact.** Machined
floors under an upright flat tool now read exactly their plane
(`flat_floor_entry`); before, they read ~1.2e-12 high, and `above(z)`
counted a whole floor (1461 mm^2 on the Pocket3D fixture) as standing.
Dropped: an epsilon on the comparison, which accepts a rounding the
law calls a bug.

(4) **Edge ties follow the column engine** (`flat_tie`: side
inclusive, bottom exclusive). This replaces part of M7.3 A (5)'s
uniform nudge; worst deviation between engines fell to 4.5e-13. Owed:
field `measure` proven on the goldens, exact floors for ball and
taper, dexel.rs at 445 lines.

## M11.2 C+D - transitions and keep-down links on every ladder op: eight decisions (2026-11-05)

(1) **The descent between levels is its own parameter.** Default "same
as entry" posts today's entry byte for byte; Plunge / Ramp (angle) /
Helix (pitch) / vertical Arc are explicit choices. Dropped: reusing
the entry (it can't keep down while entering differently) and a
per-op `level_link` (contour's is now one instance of `Links`).

(2) **One `Links` struct on every ladder kind,** compared against each
kind's own default. The 3D ladder's default pass link is keep-down,
because that is what it always did; one uniform default would have
changed every 3D rough.

(3) **An explicit Ramp zig-zags along the first cut at no more than the
angle; a "same as entry" Ramp keeps its single steep chord**, so
existing ramp paths don't change.

(4) **The keep-down proof.** A link stays down only inside the
certified area, crossing none of the level's planned passes or that
plane's dive links (found by test: the verifier flagged a crossing),
within `max_stay_down`. Otherwise it lifts to the retract plane, with
one note per reason. 3D unproved pass hops stay silent as before.

(5) **The helix was never broken in the CL.** Each half-turn is one arc
carrying its own Z; the viewport drew every chord at the move's start
Z. The display spreads Z along the chords, merged with M11.2 A's
vertical-arc chords into one `segments3` route. The helix dive point
snaps to the 1 um grid so a keep-down link meets it exactly (under
0.5 um; no golden uses a helix).

(6) **Format.** An optional, diff-only `links` key with no version bump.
Contour's old keys are still read, and still written when they say
everything, so the previous build reads them. An older build ignores
`links` and loads defaults (the `blend_turns` exposure). A contour
saved with the old stay-down ramp goes Stale once and regenerates
identically.

(7) **Contour keep-down Arc falls back to a plunge on the ring, named.**
Once the lead-out is skipped the tool is committed to staying down,
and a plunge on the proven ring is always legal.

(8) **"Leads & Links" is renamed "Lead in / Lead out"** and appears on
every ladder kind; Entry moved there from Passes and Feeds. Found,
owed: a 3D Pocket with Helix entry run to the stock bottom on the
user's part makes a sliver level under the bore's solid floor (caught
by verify, post blocked - not silent; the generator fix is tracked).
contour.rs dropped 689 -> 338 lines and ladder.rs 596 -> 295.

## M11.5 - area control and open boundaries: seven decisions (2026-11-06)

(1) **The settings live on the operation** (`area: AreaControls` beside
tool/src/setup), not in `OpParams`, so no kind's field list churns. The
defaults are exactly today's behaviour: no stamp bytes, no file key,
no version bump, goldens unchanged. Valid on Face, Contour, Pocket,
Adaptive2D, Offset2D and Pocket3D; other kinds refuse non-defaults.

(2) **One order, through the M11.4 seam:** open boundary, offset
(round/sharp - `geo2d::offset_sharp` added), extension (grown except
where part material stands), includes, containment, excludes. All
world reads are resolved once in `collect_job`; `run_job` stays pure.

(3) **Containment is relative to what each kind already does**
(default "as the kind cuts"; On adds a tool radius, Outside a tool
diameter), so containment never pushes a pocket into the part: the
part's own material is always taken back out.

(4) **Excludes are a hard keep-out for the whole tool on clearing
kinds**, and reshape the ring for Contour.

(5) **Open boundaries (the user's E).** The chain runs on straight past
its ends and splits the stock outline in two. "Inside" is the side
holding more of the op's own area (an exact tie takes the left,
walking from the chain's lower end). Face lays its rows parallel to the
chain, far side first, starting in air outside the stock and finishing
with the tool edge on the chain; pocket kinds reach a tool diameter past
the stock so their outer passes start in air. Contour, and any boundary
on a 3+2-indexed op, refuse by name for now.

(6) **Face clears a bounding rectangle**, so a shaped area that would
cross an exclude, the far side of an open boundary, or part material
above Cut Z refuses by name with a pointer to Pocket. An empty area
names the step that emptied it.

(7) **UI:** a collapsed "Boundary" group on the Geometry tab (same
question as the selection; a new tab would change every kind's bar).
Apply sends one combined `EditOperationParams::with_area` undo step;
include/exclude/open pick buttons route viewport clicks into the
page's draft until Apply. Dropped: a non-identity Face default (the
ROADMAP floated "past the stock outline by default"; it stays opt-in
so the facing goldens hold).

## M13.4 - polish: catalog hint and colour-vision palettes: four decisions (2026-11-06)

(1) **The catalog hint names the entry nearest 6 mm** from the family's
first stocked kind (blades by ground width, since they share one 16 mm
body). Dropped: the smallest size (a 2 mm drill is the fragile one) and
the op's hole size (`create_refusal` has no params to read it from).

(2) **Colour vision is a view preference, not a document setting.** It
is a command-law world singleton (`SetColorVision`, undoable), not
saved, and survives New/Open: a protan user's file opened by a
colleague shouldn't wear the protan palette.

(3) **Hand-tuned remaps, gated by simulation.** Machado, Oliveira &
Fernandes 2009 at full severity; every must-distinguish pair (13)
keeps CIEDE2000 >= 20 through that eye (weakest: protan 25.5, deutan
27.5, tritan 24.3), and the theme must stay WCAG-readable through it.
Off is pixel-identical (house palette's weakest pair is 11.2, which Off
doesn't promise). Dropped: algorithmic daltonisation.

(4) **Owed:** the warning/error text colours in pages.rs are not
remapped yet.

## 3D ladder blind floor + M11.2 B true vertical arcs: six decisions (2026-11-06)

(1) **Island law = section union the down-facing shadow** (`machining3d::
rest::material_above`/`level_target`). The plain cross-section at a
level is empty below a part's underside, so a level under a closed
blind floor read as open air and a helix dove through solid to reach it.
The shadow of every down-facing facet above the plane closes that. The
shadow is subtracted only when it overlaps the target by more than
1e-6 mm^2, so existing outputs stay byte-identical. The verifier keeps
the plain section (`geometry::slice::material_above`).

(2) **Entry legality reuses the cutter-centre proof**, which the new
law makes sound again (the target only grows as z falls). A 1152-run
fuzz over blind-hole depths, bottoms, stepdowns, entries and shells
holds it. Same bug class owed in app `area.rs` and motion
`contour_depth.rs` (in flight), plus a pre-existing shell + Ramp
`Crossing` warning the fuzz pins.

(3) **M11.2 B: the plane follows exact axis alignment of the entry
chord.** X gives G18 (XZ), Y gives G19 (YZ), with the arc centre above
the end so it's tangent at the bottom; oblique stays chords plus one
note ("no standard plane"). Dropped: posting oblique arcs as single
moves.

(4) **Near-axis snap.** A cut within the chord tolerance of an axis is
turned onto that plane and proven again by the same room test
(tessellated bores entered with a 3 um skew). Larger rotations break
tangency and are not done.

(5) **The oblique note is said once per path** (`PathBuilder::note_once`).

(6) **One golden regenerated**: contour_bore_arc_entry.cl, 52 -> 26
moves (three YZ G2 arcs). Known gap: the user's part enters 4.4 deg off
X, so it stays chords; an axis-aligned lead start is in M11.3's brief.

## M13.2 - machine limits and cutting data: seven decisions (2026-11-06)

(1) **Spindle power joins the machine-check gate.** Pc = ae*ap*vf*kc /
(60e6*eta), with kc = kc1.1*hm^-mc and hm the mean chip thickness. It
claims only when machine power, document material, tool flutes and an
engagement the op fixes are all stated (the unstated-limit law). RPM
and feed checks already existed and already blocked the post; they now
have tests proving it.

(2) **Worst case for pocket/offset/slot (ae = D)** - it may over-warn,
never under-warn. Adaptive ladders use ae = load*D; a face with
stepdown uses min(stepover, D). Contour, finishing and multi-axis ops
make no power claim.

(3) **A homegrown table of six materials** (ISO 513 letters as public
classification; our own numbers inside Machinery's Handbook / Kienzle
ranges). Suggestions take the middle of each range; fz scales with
diameter in five bands of our own choosing. Spindle efficiency is a
fixed 0.8 (a `.mch` key is a possible follow-on).

(4) **Chip thinning raises the suggested feed where the op rides an
optimal load** (hex = fz*sin(phi), phi = acos(1 - 2ae/D)), floored at 5%
load so the factor can't run away (at most ~2.29x). Clamped to the
machine's stated spindle range and XY feed, each clamp named.

(5) **The rpm lives on the tool**, so "Apply suggestion" changes it for
every op using that tool - one composite undo step (EditOperationParams
+ ChangeTool). Dropped: a per-op spindle override (a schema change on
every op). The suggestion never overwrites typed numbers (disabled
while the page has unapplied edits).

(6) **Unstated never means assumed.** No flutes or tool material means
no suggestion and no power claim. Catalog mills now state carbide and
their flute count; drills, taps and turning tools don't.

(7) **Format and UI.** The document material, tool material and flutes
are additive keys, skipped when unset, so no version bump; an unknown
material word refuses the file by name. They're edited from a "Cutting
data" group on the Feeds tab, so the tool editor's snapshot holds.

## The shadow law for 2D pockets and contours: five decisions (2026-11-06)

(1) **The shadow law lives in `geometry::slice`** as `shadow_above` /
`material_overhead` (section union the down-facing shadow), shared by
the 3D ladder, 2D pocket regions and contour rings.
`slice::material_above` keeps its plain-section meaning for the
verifier. Dropped: a motion-only API, since app and contour both need
it from the layer that owns the mesh.

(2) **Both 2D sites were real and silent.** A pocket with Bottom below
a 1 mm blind floor that no plane slices plunged through the floor
(analytic check hit, verify silent). A contour shank passed through a
sloped overhang slab whose vertex-height sections missed the ring.
Pocket regions add the shadow only where it covers more than 1e-6 mm^2
beyond the section; contour checks section and shadow separately.
Untouched regions stay byte-identical.

(3) **A Bottom below a closed floor that no plane slices refuses by
name**, consistent with the existing refusal; clamping to the floor
was dropped.

(4) **The shell + Ramp `Crossing` was a real self-crossing.** The
ramp's flat tail at level depth cut across the next zigzag row. It now
goes through `dive_link` (fed when it crosses nothing, else hop and
plunge at the pass start); 72/1152 fuzz warnings -> 0, and the fuzz
now requires a silent verify. Re-anchoring the ramp was dropped (it
would change every shell + Ramp path).

(5) **The verifier itself still reads plain sections**, so it can't see
a cut under an overhang or the part's underside. It is the backstop
every generator relies on: the shadow-aware verifier is in flight as
top priority, with boundary_ctx.rs's two plain-section reads.

## Merge batch 2026-11-06: boundary picking, op-page fixes, M13.1 (HSM adaptive round 1 held back)

**M11.4 C round 1 - HELD BACK, not merged.** The batch gate found its path crossing itself on a 60x40 Adaptive pocket (a gouge risk) and 4 descents instead of 2 on the user's bore once merged with the entry work. Round 2 must pass both as acceptance tests. The design notes below stand for round 2.
(1) Measured, not asserted: a `quality` module runs any path through
the dexel stock and reports contact angle and load, slotting length,
direction changes, curvature, air, retracts, descents per level and
rest. (2) The spiral grows out of the helix bore (Stori & Wright 2000;
Held & Spielberger 2009), with Dubins-linked open rounds (Otkur &
Lazoglu 2007) and a rounded wall lap (Pateloup 2004). One descent per
level - the user's "the first entry should be enough". (3) Acceptance
was NOT met: the bore peaks at 19.9% (target 14.6%), the rectangle at
26.7%, there are 14-16 small kinks, and air rose 70x. L-pocket, islands
and slots fall back to rings by name; an incomplete plan (>2% left) is
never posted. Round 2 is in flight with hard targets. (4) The old
behaviour is kept as `PocketStrategy::OffsetRings`, an explicit choice;
PROJECT_VERSION 48 -> 49 with a migration (existing Adaptive ops go
Stale once).

**Boundary picking (user: "very unclear how the open boundary selection
works").** (1) While collecting a boundary, an Edge click takes one
geometric edge (a run: one straight stretch or one arc; chains split
where neighbouring stretches differ by >2x). Ctrl toggles, Shift closes
around the most horizontal face loop, Alt takes a single segment. The
selection's own Edge pick is unchanged. (2) An open chain in
Include/Exclude is caught at the pick with a one-click "Use as open
boundary", and refused at Apply and Generate - never silently
auto-routed. (3) One boundary list over the existing data model, side
A/B = Inside/Outside, no file change. (4) Old chain ids resolve first,
which also fixes Alt-picked segments that never resolved. (5) Role
colours live in the colour-vision palette; the side arrows are read
from the machined-area preview, not a second copy of the side rule.

**Op page (user: "the error persists ... delete deletes the operation").**
(1) A page error is tied to the page, document version and draft it
was raised on, and clears when any of them change. (2) `ClearToolpath`
is undoable (cache and stamp restored exactly). The footer reads
Generate | Clear toolpath | Delete operation, with Delete still
confirm-free (Ctrl+Z restores). (3) The "projects to a line from above"
refusal fires at the doors for the pocket family only; other selection
refusals stay at Generate so chains can be built one edge at a time.
(4) A disabled Apply explains itself, naming the invalid field by
comparing the draft to the saved operation.

**M13.1 - stock engine shapes.** (1) The bull nose is an exact
rounded-rectangle distance (Quilez sdRoundedBox / opRevolution): level
moves and plunges in closed form, oblique moves by golden section, with
a column-engine twin; the agreement suite gained four bull replays and
holds at ~1e-11. (2) A march entry is capped at the mesh boundary where
the uncut stock is air above. (3) Lathe and rotary cuts are refused by
name in `plan_program`; the annular-sector sweep is still owed. (4) An
over-budget hidden-rest scan is `HiddenRest::OverBudget` plus
`Warning::RestUnjudged` ("NOT JUDGED"), which blocks the post; dropped:
a non-blocking advisory.

## M11.3 B-D - lead in / lead out, complete, and the user's entry reports: eight decisions (2026-11-06)

(1) **One `Approach` struct inside `Links`** carries every new
entry/lead/feed setting. It is a diff-only file key with stamp bytes
only when non-default, so there's no version bump. Centre cutting is
read from the tool at generation and never saved on the op.

(2) **Default plunge height 2 mm** (user: "why does it plunge straight
into the material ... from high above"). Plunges rapid to material top
+ 2 mm, then feed. Material top is the level above (plain ladders) or
the top of cut (contour walls, 3D shells - the only height known to be
air there). This deliberately changed 11 CL + 40 NC goldens.

(3) **One entry per level** (user: "the first entry should be enough ...
the linking should go from that entry into the circles"). The descent
ends on the first pass's start; on a wall start, it lands a little
along the first pass and feeds back at depth. A second dive that still
can't be avoided is named on the op page with a fix, never silent.

(4) **Centre cutting** (`Tool.center_cutting`, true for the whole
catalog; a tool-editor checkbox). A non-centre-cutting tool never dives
into solid: helix, then ramp, else the op is refused by name.
Between-pass plunges within a level are not yet checked.

(5) **Fallback order: helix, ramp along the first cut, plunge.** New
pocket-family ops seed Helix at 0.4 x tool radius, so the HSM spiral
has a bore to grow from; stored ops keep their entry.

(6) **Entry parameters** (user: "Arc: radius and length; Ramp: angle or
length; extension values; plunge data; engagement"): ramp angle / max
leg / ramp-to-depth; helix min radius / pitch or angle / direction; arc
radius / sweep; separate descent, plunge and lead-in feeds; an
engagement limit that slows the descent and its first link
(removal-rate reading).

(7) **Contour leads:** lead-out shape (new Perpendicular, appended - an
older build refuses the file by name), extensions, vertical lead-in
height, overlap (re-cuts the walk's own segments; dropped with a note if
the lead-out would cross the lead-in), and the axis-aligned lead start
(1 deg) that gives the user's part true G18/G19 arc entries.

(8) **Visibility:** entry fallbacks, second dives and lifted links read
as plain "Entry: ... - fix: ..." lines under the op status. Owed:
horizontal-plane arc entry for pockets, slowing only the first stretch
for the engagement limit, and removing (not just naming) second dives
on wall-start rows. Existing ops keep their cached high plunges until
regenerated.

## The exact solid-law verifier + post-gate visibility: eight decisions (2026-11-06)

(1) **An exact solid law (swept convex atoms + ray parity)**, not plane
sections. A straight move meets a facet exactly when the tool stack
meets the facet extruded back along the move (convex Minkowski); the
height-wise radius difference is convex, found by golden section. XY
arcs are swept chordwise with 2 um widening; vertical-plane arcs are
sampled every 0.25 mm (the stated limit). Catches the thin blind floor,
the overhang slab and the undercut lip, which plane sections missed;
every judged golden verifies warning for warning as before. 41 ms for a
full verify of the user's part in release. Dropped: material_overhead
per sample plane (still samples) and voxel/SDF (resolution-bound).

(2) **Penetration is measured sideways**, which can over-report but
never hide a cut.

(3) **Edge vs body.** Contact by the fluted length is a Gouge; contact
by only the shank or holder bands is ShankHit on the part, said once.
Dropped: reporting band contact as Gouge ("cuts past the finish
surface" when the edge didn't), found on the demo contour's shank.

(4) **The 2D-op check uses the square stack** (`VerifyContext` has no
tip shape yet - it may over-report, never hide); drill, bore and thread
use their real tips plus a hole-wall chord-dip excuse the goldens prove
needed. Owed: carry `Cutter` into `VerifyContext`; the shank, sweep and
rapid-in-stock laws still read plain sections for uncut stock under
overhangs; mid-move pose changes are judged at the end pose.

(5) **The Face/Boundary blocked region uses material_overhead**, so an
extended face under a ledge refuses by name.

(6) **"Stock sim did not judge this program: <reason>" is visible** on
the post result, status line and G-code viewer header, never in the NC
file. It blocks only when some op also lacks a generator-time verdict.
Dropped: always blocking (every rotary/turn/posed program unpostable)
and silence.

(7) **The column engine refuses posed moves by name** instead of
cutting them upright; rest machining after a posed op refuses by name.
Dropped: routing the verdict to the field engine, whose top-down
heights can't see a gouge under an overhang that a tilted tool reaches.

(8) **Found: rotary ops can't post** (verify convicts hundreds of
shank/sweep hits on box/cylinder stock) - under investigation.

## M11.4 C - the HSM adaptive, merged (round 2 + rebase): seven decisions (2026-11-06)

(1) **Acceptance met where the spiral runs.** Bore R12.5, rectangle
60x40 and the L-pocket: peak load 15.4% (target <= 16.1% = 14.64% +
10%), 0 direction changes over 5 deg in cut, no slotting, one descent
per level, no self-crossing, clean under the exact solid-law verifier.
Island and narrow-slot pockets fall back to Offset rings by name.

(2) **One engagement law for planning and measuring** (D/120 grid,
same rim, 360 samples, same wall rule), with a +5% planning margin;
Adaptive passes are posted unfitted (sub-micron chords), because a 10 um
arc fit made spiral turns cross and ride off walls.

(3) **Morph spiral for star-shaped areas** (Held & Spielberger 2009;
Bieterman & Sandstrom 2003; Serra's opening; Stori & Wright 2000 per
revolution), with the entry spot in the area's kernel (Lee & Preparata
1979) and the helix narrowed to fit, named. A corner scallop at
R = 0.5r is left and named for finishing.

(4) **A crossing guard refuses any self-crossing plan** and Offset rings
cut instead, named. Dropped: retract hops with fronts, and an annulus
spiral around islands (both crossed or overloaded).

(5) **The entry goes through the shared descent** (M11.3), so one entry
per level, the 2 mm plunge height and centre cutting apply to Adaptive
too; the helix closes exactly on the spiral's start.

(6) **The old rings stay as `PocketStrategy::OffsetRings`.**
PROJECT_VERSION 48 -> 49 with a migration; existing Adaptive ops go
Stale once and regenerate as the spiral.

(7) **Owed:** islands and channels without fallback (medial-axis cells
or true trochoids), an achievable air target (2x the rings looks
unreachable with climb-only constant engagement - the rings' low air
comes from slotting at 100% load), and the Pocket3D per-level port.
Slow generation tests were shrunk or moved to the heavy lane, none
dropped.

## Small owed UI items: two decisions (2026-11-06)

(1) **Warning and error text follow the colour-vision setting**, with
one ink set per panel lightness (no single colour reads 4.5:1 on both
panels). Under protan/deutan, meaning moves to blue-yellow (yellow
warning, violet error); under tritan to red-cyan. Off stays exempt and
pixel-identical.

(2) **Height-relationship notes resolve Selection heights** through the
op's source, and an unresolved one says why instead of staying silent.

## M11.3 owed: the centre-cutting law on every plunge: five decisions (2026-11-06)

(1) **One check, `plunge_law`.** A column counts as cleared only if an
earlier cut in the same path, entirely at or below the plunge depth,
passed within half a tool radius of the axis (the core left errs to
solid); unseen stock counts as solid. Dropped: plane-section and
stock-model readings, which need data the generators don't have.

(2) **A solid pass start inside a level** falls back exactly like the
level entry: helix, then ramp along the pass, then refusal by name.
Contour stay-downs ramp along the ring; a sweep-capped arc below the
material top and a ramp with no run count as plunges for a
non-centre-cutting tool. A non-centre-cutting slot with Plunge entry
certifies the stadium so the fallbacks can work.

(3) **Second dives on wall-start zigzag/slot rows: none exist** (the
M11.3 land-along-the-pass already removed them); pinned by a test. The
3-D ladder's and the contour bore side's named second dives stay owed.

(4) **Engagement limit:** each level's first tool diameter of cut runs
at the scaled feed on planar ladders; 3-D first-stretch slowing owed.

(5) **Owed:** plunge checks in finishing3d, drilling and face. Gate
note: two gate agents stalled waiting on notifications; the main
session ran this gate itself (debug 1455 passed, clippy, both heavy
lanes), excluding ui (no ui change).

## Rotary and 5-axis: the pivot law: six decisions (2026-11-06)

(1) **Posed ball tools post the tip, not the centre.** The posted tip
is the ball centre minus r·axis, on every multi-axis generator.
Before this, the stamp kinds sat 2–4.5 mm off their plan (Contour5D
on a bar was 4.20 mm off, Swarf 4.54 mm); after, they are 0.001 mm
off. Dropped: correcting this in the post, which would leave the
CLFile and the verifier disagreeing with the G-code.

(2) **Rapids carry their pose.** A rapid between posed moves keeps the
tool axis it travels with, so the scan, the verifier and the post all
see the same orientation. Dropped: snapping to vertical on every
rapid (a hidden rotary move).

(3) **Rotary ops are judged radially (`Mode::Rotary`).** For wrapped
toolpaths the verifier measures depth along the radius from the
rotary axis, not as Z (`app::operation::rotary_law`, `sim::verify::rotary`).

(4) **Posed-contact law f2** (`sim::verify::contact`): a posed tool's
contact point comes from its axis and tip shape, never from the
vertical-tool shortcut.

(5) **A0B0C0 after a lean.** The post returns the rotaries to zero
before the next upright section, rather than relying on the next
op's first move.

(6) **The stock scan lifts posed moves** instead of dropping them, so
`dome_flow_is_envelope_clean` holds. Owed, tracked in Phase 13 / task
follow-ups: the swarf_multi coarse rung (a convicted 0.39 mm gouge,
reported, not silent), the rotary first move being a rapid from the
world origin, the upright all-air finish being unjudged, Rotary Offset
from the stock radius, and Rotary Parallel radial retracts.

## M13.7 A: the real tip in the verifier, and posed moves at the direct subtract: four decisions (2026-11-06)

(1) **`VerifyContext` carries the op's `Cutter`** (`cutter: Option<Cutter>`,
`Some(Cutter::of(&tool))` from both verify sites in generate.rs). The
solid law (b2) sweeps the real tip. `Cutter::judged` trusts it only
when its stack, ignoring the tip, is exactly `Cutter::flat(geom)`;
anything else falls back to the square stack, which can only
over-report. Dropped: trusting any supplied cutter, since a mismatched
one could clear a real gouge.

(2) **The section law (b) reads its slice at `tip_height()` above
the tip**, the height where the real tool first reaches full radius
(0 for a flat end, so a flat end's verdict is byte-identical). The
band below it is judged exactly by b2, which always runs on the same
model. Without this lift, (b)'s square rim convicted ball and bull
passes first and the real tip changed nothing. Wider effect: 3D Area
kinds with ball or bull tools convict less in the tip band, and only
where b2 clears it; the heavy lane confirmed no golden or law
changed.

(3) **Motion's direct `Dexel::subtract` is gated**
(`machining3d/feed.rs::subtract_upright`). A posed feed move is
refused by name with the stock-sim door's own `POSED_REFUSAL` before
any column is lowered. Posed rapids pass, matching the door's rule.

(4) **Owed:**
- an app-level end-to-end ball-Contour test;
- `sim/verify/engine.rs` is 658 lines against the 400-line law, which
  predates this change; split it at the next verifier change;
- M13.7's overhang laws and mid-move pose changes are still open.

## M11.1: line-to-arc and arc-to-arc corner fillets: three decisions (2026-11-06)

(1) **Built from offset curves.** The line is offset by ρ to the
turn's inside, the arc to R∓ρ, and the fillet centre is their
intersection; tangent points are the centre's feet. Written from
plane geometry (`machining2d/fillet_arc.rs`). Radius rules are those
of the line case: at most the tool radius, halved up to 4 times
before the corner stays sharp and is counted.

(2) **Never gouge, err to sharp.** A candidate is used only when:
- both tangent points fall on the half of their element nearest the
  corner;
- it turns with the travel direction and sweeps less than π;
- no edge of the legal-centre region crosses it.

Turns toward the part are refused before construction. Because the
region is a polyline while the path rides arcs, some safe fillets
are refused near tangent points; that is accepted as conservative.

(3) **A closed path's start/end corner stays sharp, by design.** It is
the entry/exit seam, owned by the lead in / lead out (M11.3), and is
named in the op notes. Dropped: rounding the seam, which would move
the lead's tangent point.

## M13.8 A: rotary start, stock radius, radial links: four decisions (2026-11-06)

(1) **A rotary program opens on its clearance pose.** The planner's
opening traverse from its frame home is skipped. In a rotary frame
that home is the axis line or angle zero: a Contour started at radius
0, the others at the wrong angle. The program now opens with a rapid
at the clearance radius above the first cut, on that cut's own angle,
holding the pure radial pose (`multiaxis/rotary_links.rs::opening`).

(2) **Rotary Offset peels from the stock's outer radius** about the
fitted axis, never less than the part's own; with no separate stock
the output is unchanged move for move. Before: over a d20 bar on an
r6 part, the first level sat at radius 6, rapids hopped at 9.5
through uncut bar, and verify convicted RapidInStock. After: the first
level is at radius 10 and verify gives zero warnings.

(3) **Rotary Parallel links are radial.** Each link is a radial
retract to the retract cylinder, an index around it (chords sized by
`ARC_FIT_TOL` sagitta, short way round), and a radial plunge into the
next pass. A clearance or retract that does not clear the part's
radius is refused by name. Treated as a correctness fix, not a
strategy fork: a Z lift on a turned bar is a sideways sweep of a
radially posed tool, never a valid choice, so it is not a user
parameter.

(4) **Owed (M13.8):**
- Offset clears both laps of the developed strip at air levels:
  11,967 moves on a d20 bar vs about 2,064. Safe, but wasteful.
- Downward radial retracts below the equator rely on the machine and
  fixture check for anything inside the clearance cylinder.

## M13.7 B: the verifier split, a real-tip end-to-end test, and the leave sign in law (b): four decisions (2026-11-06)

(1) **`sim/verify/engine.rs` split along its law seams** into
`crossing.rs` (a), `rest.rs` (the shared rest-material model),
`section.rs` (b + b2, which share one mode gate), `reach.rs`
(c, c3, e), `rapids.rs` (d) and `finish.rs` (f, f2). The dispatcher
dropped from 658 to 60 lines. It is a pure move: until the scaffolding
was removed, the old engine ran beside the new one and any difference
in warnings was a panic. No difference showed over 889 debug tests and
the release heavy lane.

(2) **The end-to-end real-tip test uses a bull nose, not a ball.**
The tool law refuses ball ends for 2D ops when the op is created, so
no ball Contour can exist. `real_tip_contour.rs` runs a catalog bull
nose along a filleted wall through the real app path, clean with its
tip, and the square stack convicts the same path.

(3) **Law (b) had the leave sign backwards (Prime Directive).** It
convicted at `d < r - leave - tol`. A positive leave therefore let the
tool sink `leave` into the finished wall unconvicted: a 0.5 mm leave
hid a 0.5 mm gouge. A negative leave, a deliberate overcut,
over-reported. It now uses b2's own allowance, `r - max(-leave, 0) -
tol`; both directions are pinned in `crates/app/tests/verify.rs`.
Dropped: `r + leave - tol`, which would convict a path for cutting
into its own finishing allowance, a quality question rather than a
gouge.

(4) **Owed (tracked in M13.7):** the 2D depth ladder reads the part
with 0.02 mm of slack where the verifier allows 0.01 mm. A flat-end
pass can therefore end where the square reading reports a gouge.
That errs safe, but can block a post for no real gouge; align the two
tolerances.

## M13.8 B: swarf rungs, Offset air laps, and the dead ridge law: three decisions (2026-11-06)

(1) **A coarse swarf rung relaxes only its spacing.** Each rung
multiplied the whole tolerance by 4^i: the march deviation, chord
budget, first sample step, ring chords, scan directions and the
`r - tol` contact limits. So at tol 0.4 the plan itself dug 0.39 mm.
Now only the raster step and ring stepdown scale (`raster_pass_spaced`);
every gouge-side limit stays nominal. The capped-blade adv swarf
deviation went 0.3924 -> 0.0963 mm, the same as single-pass swarf.

(2) **Rotary Offset clears one lap at air levels**
(`machining3d::pocket3d_air_split`). Levels above the part's max
radius plus leave sweep one lap plus seam pads; every level that can
touch the part keeps both laps and the seam copy. A d20 bar went from
11,967 to 7,082 moves, and rotary verify still gives zero warnings.
With no air level, the output is identical move for move.

(3) **The ridge rest law stays as a reading; making it convict is a
tracked milestone, not a silent change.** Proof that it is dead: it
judges a point only when two segments come within `band = r + tol +
floor`, so its rest `dmin - r - floor <= tol`, always under its gate
`tol + floor`. It can never convict, so a finish with too wide a
stepover verifies silently.
- A reachable version (opposite-side segments within a reach;
  ball-unreachable creases excused) convicted 9-12 shipped finish
  fixtures at 0.13-0.35 mm against a 0.12 gate, including
  `dome_flow_is_envelope_clean`. That is real excess scallop the dead
  law hid.
- This is quality (scallop over tolerance), not a gouge or a
  collision, so the Prime Directive does not force it ahead of the
  generator fixes.
- Landing it alone would red the heavy lane; removing it would drop
  the sub-tolerance rest numbers tests read, for no gain.
- Kept as a reading. The reachable law (patch saved in the job tmp as
  ridge-flank-law.patch) lands together with the finish-generator
  stepover fixes as M13.9.

## Traced playback off the UI thread: four decisions (2026-11-06, user report)

The user reported: "Simulation is extremely taxing, the voxel model is not even
updating as the cutter goes around it. And at times it even locks up."

(1) **The timeline is cached per document version** (`shell::cached_script`).
It used to be rebuilt twice a frame, cloning every toolpath each time (about
1.1 MB/frame on the bench).

(2) **A worker thread owns the playback** (`app::stock_play_worker::PlayWorker`):
- the world is read on the UI thread, then the fields are built on the worker;
- seeks are latest-wins, cut in adaptive ~15 ms chunks;
- results are published at 20 Hz or when the worker catches up;
- failures arrive as errors ("traced playback refused") and never panic;
- dropping the worker joins it.

Considered and dropped: keeping the work on the UI thread and only throttling
it. A long jump still froze the window for 12 s.

(3) **Copy-on-write uncut bricks and cut-layer-only GPU rewrites.** A
checkpoint or snapshot copies only the cut layers. The eye rewrites the cut
layer in place within one playback session.

Result: the UI frame went from 182 ms mean / 757 ms max to 0.13 / 0.83 ms. A
full-length jump now takes 14.8 s instead of 12.4 s, but the UI stays live.

(4) **The suspected doc_version reset is refuted.** Only user commands bump it,
and arming Deviate mid-play correctly restarts. The "not updating" symptom was
(1)-(3) starving the frame.

Owed:
- dirty-brick upload (the full ~1 MB cut layer is still sent per picture);
- jump throughput;
- the CPU-fallback eye still draws on the UI thread (at 20 Hz max).

## Ladder tolerance and the all-air finish: two decisions (2026-11-06)

(1) **The 2D depth ladder's slack is 0.008 mm, not 0.02** (`contour_depth.rs`
`LEGAL_SLACK`). The verifier's tangency law allows 0.01 mm, so the generator
must be stricter than its own judge: 2 µm margin for the two sections'
separate quantization, and 3 µm above the 5 µm round-join sag so plain walls
stay walkable. A flat-end Contour beside a 0.0145 mm-leaning facet now ends at
the wall foot and verifies clean. No golden moved.

(2) **An upright finish proven to cut nothing gets a note, not a warning.**
`verify::cuts_no_material` proves it: every cutting move is upright, and its
lowest tool point is at or above the stock and model tops. `air_law` then
attaches "finish cuts no material: … check the op's heights" once.
- It informs and does not block the post: cutting air is safe.
- Anything not provable keeps today's verdict.

## The crossing law bucketed: one decision (2026-11-06)

**Law (a) uses a uniform grid instead of all-pairs** (Franklin 1989). A proper
crossing lies in both chords' bounding boxes, so both chords are filed in that
cell. Each pair is tested once, in the first cell both boxes cover. Very long
and non-finite chords are tested against all chords.
- Output is sorted and deduped as before, so warnings are byte-identical.
- The all-pairs version is kept as the reference, and 3 equivalence tests
  assert identical pair sets.
- On a 50k-move path: 30.6 ms vs 3.33 s (109x).

## The operation dialog, Fusion-style: five decisions (2026-11-06, user review)

User: "unclear what open boundary affects.. Unclear what boundary actually does. Interface is hard to read, badly organised" and "the UX is very very bad and is not reflecting the fusion360 experience that was requested". Only the general layout conventions are followed, clean-room: no Autodesk text, icons or layouts.

(1) **One set of form helpers** in `egui_app/layout/form.rs`, re-exported from `layout`. Every page uses them:
- `prop_row` / `prop_grid`: label in a fixed 120 px column, the control right-aligned on the same row;
- `check_row`, `hint` (help as a hover tooltip) and `consequence` (the one dimmed safety line kept);
- `group` / `group_open`: collapsible groups, with an optional on/off checkbox in the header;
- `value_with_unit`, `auto_value`, `status_banner`, `action_bar`.

The 120/96 px label columns fit the default ~280 px properties pane.

(2) **"0 = auto" becomes an explicit Auto toggle in the UI only.** Turning Auto on writes the model's 0, so params, commands and files are unchanged. Turning it off seeds a sensible value: ramp angle 3°, plunge height 2 mm, engagement limit 50%, and so on.

(3) **Show only what applies.** Lead in / Lead out shows only the chosen entry type's fields. Feeds and plunge sit in their own groups.

(4) **The boundary says what it does** (`boundary_summary.rs`).
- One plain sentence per setting, e.g. "Faces the stock top on the −Y side (side A) of the picked open edge, up to that edge…". The side is computed from the same calculation that places the viewport arrows, so words and arrows cannot disagree.
- "Machine the other side" flips side A and side B.
- A setting that has no effect on this kind says so in the warning colour, instead of being ignored silently.

(5) **The viewport fills the area actually swept** (`operation::machined_footprint`). For Face this is the band the passes sweep, laid along the open edge and widened by the tool overrun. Every other kind shows its existing machined region. Open edges are drawn dashed.

pages.rs went from 5,556 to 1,707 lines, split into page modules of about 390 lines or fewer. The tab bar stays.

## M11.3: the centre-cutting law in finish, drilling and face: four decisions (2026-11-06)

(1) **Audit the finished path, not the generator's internals.** Finish3D and
Face do not carry the approach model, so `plunge_law::audit` reads the path
they emit. It looks for the first axial plunge into solid onto a column the
path has not already cut. Solid means below the material top and, when the
stock's XY outline is known, inside it. Unseen stock counts as solid.

(2) **Finishes retry once with sloped entries, then refuse by name**
(`finishing3d::center_cut_guard`):
- a centre-cutting tool runs once and is unchanged;
- a non-centre-cutting tool that plunges is regenerated with ramp + entry_ramp
  forced on (the finishes have no helix);
- if it still plunges, it is refused.

Accepted cost: with unseen stock counted as solid, most such finishes below the
stock top refuse. This is conservative and cannot gouge, and ball and flat end
mills are centre-cutting.

(3) **Drill cycles that cut solid (Spot/Drill/Peck/Deep) refuse a
non-centre-cutting tool.** The M10.1 tool law checks only the tool family and
did not catch this. Tap, Bore and BackBore read the hole as already drilled and
pass.

(4) **A Face entry is judged against the stock outline.** Facing the stock's own
footprint enters tangent to its edge, which is air and passes; this is pinned.
Facing an inner patch of a wider stock is refused by name.

Owed:
- a Face fallback that moves the entry out past the stock instead of refusing;
- guards for 5-axis Contour/Parallel (tilted descents);
- counting stock that earlier ops already cleared.

## M11.4 C round 5: microlift returns, a hop budget, and the honest 5° kink law: three decisions (2026-11-06)

(1) **Microlift returns land for grown plans (slot, channel, island).** Rounds
4 and 5 are merged; the crossing-law part landed separately in 6ba671b. The
spiral is cut only where it bites. Its pieces are joined by lifted returns
that:
- go straight across already-cleared stock;
- are checked to stay in the area, sweep no stock, avoid the entry helix,
  and never cross another return.

Narrow slot results:
- floor air 11 m -> 0.9 m;
- moves 68k -> 43k;
- load 15.4%;
- verify clean.

Star plans (bore, rectangle, L) are not lifted; they post the round-2 spiral.
Dropped: cell decomposition, which needs a new descent per cell and so breaks
the one-descent-per-level law.

(2) **A retract-hop budget of 8 per level.** A plan that would need more
retract hops is refused, and the pocket falls back to Offset rings by name,
for example: "the HSM plan would reach 9 passes a level by retract hops (over
8) - Offset rings cut this pocket instead". The island now does this in 109 s
instead of 492 s of routing. Scheduling stops early once the cap is passed,
and a half-scheduled plan is never posted.

(3) **The 5° kink law is measured honestly and ratcheted.** Main's report
printed "past 5 deg" but measured at the 10° default. At a true 5°:
- rectangle shows 110 breaks (worst 6.4°);
- L shows 202 breaks (worst 6.6°);
- the slot's entry orbit shows 2 breaks (5.0°).

These star-plan morph seams were never measured before and are not a
regression. The full report pins them as an upper bound (`KINK_RATCHET`): any
rise in count or in the worst angle fails. Driving them to zero (morph-seam
smoothing for star plans) is owed.

Dropped: setting the threshold back to 10°, which would hide them; and leaving
the heavy lane red.

## Operation dialog polish: three decisions (2026-11-06)

(1) **Every caption that sat above its control is now a same-row property
row.** This covers Side, Strategy, Pattern, Stepover and Minimum step. Captions
that only repeated a control's own label were removed.

(2) **Every kind's Heights tab ends in a "Levels" group** holding whichever it
has: retract hop and Retract Z, Face depth staging, the hole override,
Stepdown. Retract Z therefore now reads after Top/Bottom Z.

(3) **The remaining "0 means auto" fields became Auto toggles.** Seeds:
- Peck 2.0 mm;
- Bar advance 10.0 mm;
- Probe budget 0.02 mm;
- Stepover √(24·tol);
- Minimum step 0.1·√(12·tol);
- Steep stepover √(12·tol);
- Reference ball 24 mm.

Option-backed fields use `auto_opt`, where Auto means None. Real zeros (Bore
stock to leave, Dwell) stay plain numbers. Drill "Dwell at bottom" now reads
seconds, not mm through the inch conversion (a units bug fixed in passing).

## M11.3: the Face entry runs out to air: one decision (2026-11-06)

**A non-centre-cutting Face whose first plunge lands over stock now runs its
first row back out to air instead of refusing.**

- **How:** `machining2d::air_lead` walks back along the row, in steps of a
  quarter tool radius, until the tool disc clears the stock outline by 1 mm.
  `face_led` then shifts only the first feed's start, so the move count is
  unchanged.
- **Safety check:** the regenerated path is audited again.
- **Still refused by name:** an unknown stock outline, no air within reach,
  and a run-on crossing an exclude zone, open-boundary side or part above
  Cut Z.
- **Centre-cutting tools:** never reach this code; output is byte-identical
  (`face_led(.., 0.0) == face(..)`).
- **Accepted:** the run-on cuts a channel at Cut Z through stock beside the
  faced patch. Part gouges there are judged by the post-generation verify,
  which blocks the post.

## M11.3: the centre-cutting law along the posed axis: two decisions (2026-11-06)

(1) **A posed move is a plunge when it heads tip-first within 30° of the tool
axis** (asin of the 0.5 core fraction), not only when it is exactly axial.
Inside that cone the leading edge is the uncut core.
- The 5-axis stamp drops the ball in world Z while the tool leans, so an
  exact-axial test passed the convicted Contour5D ring entry.
- "Cleared" is judged along the axis and in world Z, within (1 − core) tool
  radii of the axis line.
- Unposed moves keep the 3-axis reading.

(2) **Every multiaxis kind built on finish params is guarded**:
- Contour5D, Parallel5D, Flow5D, Swarf, Advanced Swarf, Rotary Contour and
  Rotary Parallel retry with sloped entries, then refuse by name;
- Multi-Axis Contour refuses (it has no sloped entry);
- a centre-cutting tool reads no stock and gets the generator's path
  unchanged.

Owed (ROADMAP M11.3):
- the 3-axis reading still convicts only exactly-vertical descents, so a
  non-centre-cutting 80° unposed ramp passes; make the law uniform with the
  cone;
- a post-stamp audit for Multi-Axis Rough and Rotary Offset;
- confirm swarf/rotary actually honour the forced ramp;
- an app-level 5-axis end-to-end test.

## M13.7: stock under overhangs reaches the shank, sweep and rapid laws: two decisions (2026-11-06)

(1) **A hidden-stock backstop beside laws (c), (c3) and (d)**
(`sim/verify/hidden.rs`). It runs only when the plane-section law found
nothing, so it can add convictions but never remove one. Hidden stock at
height h is a point that:
- is inside the stock footprint and below its top;
- is shadowed by the part's down-facing faces above h;
- is not in the part's own section at h;
- is not swept by any cutting chord at or below h within a tool radius.

Results:
- shank and holder bands meeting it convict `ShankHit { part: false }`;
- mid-turn sweeps meeting it convict `SweepHit { part: false }`;
- a lateral rapid's swept disc meeting it convicts `RapidInStock` (the old law
  only sampled 3 points).
- A failed slice convicts.
- No golden program gained a warning.

(2) **Owed:** "cleared" ignores cut ORDER. A chord later in the path clears
the column for an earlier move, the same as the existing column model. This
can only under-report, so it is a known blind spot to close: judge each move
against the cuts before it.

## M11.3: one plunge cone for posed and unposed moves: one decision (2026-11-06)

**An unposed straight move counts as a plunge if it falls within 30° of straight
down**, the same cone and the same `posed_axial` call the posed law uses. It used
to count only an exactly vertical descent, so a non-centre-cutting tool
ramping into solid at 80° from horizontal passed.

- Arcs keep the exact test on purpose. A full-turn helix starts and ends at
  the same XY, so its net direction reads vertical even though every chord is
  shallow.
- No existing verdict changed.
- 3° ramps and helices stay legal. The 60° boundary is pinned to agree with
  the posed reading.
- Untested on a real part: a 3D finish running down a wall steeper than 60°
  below the stock top, with a non-centre-cutting tool, now retries with a
  ramp or refuses by name. That is the conservative verdict under the rule
  that unknown stock counts as solid.

## M13.4: vertex picking and Set origin: three decisions (2026-11-06)

(1) **Only feature corners are pickable** (`FeatureSel::Vertex`):
- they are the points where feature edges meet;
- each has an id hashed from its welded position, built like face and chain
  ids, so a pick survives re-import;
- points inside a smooth wall's tessellation are not pickable, so what can be
  picked matches what the wireframe shows.

(2) **Picking happens in screen space, nearest within 8 px, with a depth
test.** `nearest_vertex` projects each candidate through the viewport MVP and
tries them nearest first. `pick::point_visible` casts a ray from the eye. It
uses face picking's "models before stock" rule, so corners behind the
translucent stock stay pickable. The picking math is written from standard
practice.

(3) **"Set origin" on a picked vertex sends the existing `SetWcs` command**,
using the WCS pane's slot and angles, and is undoable.

Other rules:
- a vertex can drive Selection heights through its Z;
- pocket and contour refuse a vertex by name ("a point bounds nothing");
- boundaries refuse vertex picks;
- the file entry `vertex { id }` is new, so older files load unchanged.

Owed: snapping the origin to a picked face (centroid or plane).

## pick_agnostic test lane split (2026-11-06)

`pick_agnostic` went from 732.6 s to 2.95 s in debug. Its island test ran five
HSM Adaptive plans. The debug variant now runs Zigzag only, keeping every
core assertion. The `_full` twin runs Adaptive and Zigzag in the heavy lane,
71 s in release. No assertion was dropped; the test count went from 6 to 7.

## M13.8: posed moves against the fixtures: two decisions (2026-11-06)

(1) **Every posed move sweeps the whole tool against the fixture boxes**
(`verify/posed_steel.rs`). This is a real defect fix. A leaning rapid was enclosed
around the flute only, and a feed's enclosure was a vertical column at its lower
endpoint. So Rotary Parallel's downward radial index could carry the holder
60-90 mm under the bar, through a chuck, with no verdict. With the new sweep
disabled, a sim test of that case returned `[]`.

How the sweep works:
- The pose held coming in is interpolated to the pose the move states, the same
  way `rotary.rs` does it. Arcs are cut into chords.
- Flute, shank, holder and (in the bands law) spindle are each tested as a
  capsule.
- Each move is cut into intervals of at most 0.5 mm of travel at the tool's far
  end. Each capsule's radius is grown by how far its points move within an
  interval.
- Capsule-to-box distance is exact.

The sweep can only add verdicts; upright moves never enter it.

(2) **Owed:**
- posed rapids sweep flute, shank and holder but not the spindle;
- the pose is sampled per interval, not checked continuously;
- boxes are judged in the path frame, which assumes the workholding turns with
  the part (a chuck). A fixed tailstock or table judged this way errs toward a
  hit.

## M13.7: a move is judged against the cuts before it: one decision (2026-11-06)

**Law (d), (c), (c3) and the hidden-stock backstop count only earlier cuts as
cleared** (`verify/cut_index.rs`):
- every chord carries its move index;
- a uniform grid files each chord into every cell whose centre lies within
  reach plus half the cell diagonal, so a clearing chord is never missed, and
  very wide chords are always checked;
- a rapid counts cuts strictly before it;
- a shank band also counts its own move's cut, since its flute is cutting
  beneath it.

This filter only removes chords from "cleared", so verdicts can gain
convictions but never lose one. No golden program gained a warning.

One test fixture (`overhang_laws` `rapid_under`) had been clean only because of
the bug: its far side was cut after the judged rapid. It was reordered so both
sides are cut first.

## M11.3: the plunge audit after the stamp and wrap: two decisions (2026-11-06)

(1) **Multi-Axis Rough and Rotary Offset audit their FINAL posed path**
(`plunge_solid::audit_posed`). This is refuse-only: their pocket and wrap
entries already are their own ramp or helix fallback. A centre-cutting
tool reads no stock and its output is unchanged.

Rotary Offset uses the coarse "solid" reading (below top Z, over the
outline). It covers the bar and the air around it, so it errs toward
refusing.

The first app-level 5-axis test (Contour5D) lands in
`center_cut_multiaxis.rs`.

(2) **Multi-Axis Rough refusing a non-centre-cutting tool on slab-and-boss
is kept, not softened.** The stamp poses the tool along the wall normal
(+X), and the row then feeds along that same axis: the tip goes first
into the wall. For a tool with an uncut core that is a real axial
plunge.

Owed:
- Rotary Parallel's `radial_relink` always rebuilds infeeds as radial
  plunges, so the ramp retry cannot change them.
- Swarf's first raster entry always plunges.
- Rotary Offset needs a true cylinder solid. *Done (#16): see below.*

**#16 (2026-11-07): Rotary Offset's audit reads the true bar.** The
solid was the box reading (`plunge_solid::audit_posed`: below the
stock's top Z over its XY outline), which also counted the air around
the bar. It is now `multiaxis::revolved_bar`: the stock (the part's
skin with none) revolved about the same fitted axis the ladder wraps
about - radius the stock's farthest vertex, never less than the
part's; length the stations stock and part span - judged by
`plunge_law::first_bar_plunge` (same axial cone and cleared-column law;
a tip in stock iff closer to the axis than the radius and between the
stations). Chosen over adding a cylinder field to `Solid` (30 literal
sites). A block stock sweeps the cylinder through its corner, so the
bar is a superset of it: it still errs toward solid. A bar that cannot
be read refuses by name. The cylinder is a subset of the box, so the
change can only drop convictions in air, never one in the bar.

## M11.5: open boundary on Contour: two decisions (2026-11-06)

(1) **A Contour with an open boundary rides the picked chain as one open
pass** (`operation/contour_open.rs`).
- Inside and Outside mean the same as for the area kinds (the shared
  `pick_side_left` tie rule). The tool centre runs one radius plus leave
  off the chain, plus the Boundary offset. On puts the centre on the
  chain.
- The chain is extended straight past both ends by the Boundary extension,
  then `contour_along_chain` cuts it: levels, links, plunge law, leads.
- The offset is the kept side of the existing `Region::sweep` boundary
  (clipper2), so no new offsetter was written.
- Refused by name: a self-touching chain, an offset that folds, a single
  point or closed chain, and open combined with include/exclude.
- A closed-loop Contour is byte-identical.

(2) **Owed:**
- a viewport footprint for the open Contour;
- approach `ext_in` / `ext_out` on open runs;
- the summary wording "past the chain's ends";
- a partial fold is trimmed, leaving rest material (never a gouge).

## M13.4: snap the work origin to a picked face: one decision (2026-11-06)

**A picked face offers "Set origin" at its area-weighted centroid.** Horizontal
planar faces (world normal within 1° of ±Z) also offer "Set origin (Z only)",
which keeps the slot's placed XY and takes Z from the plane.
- The math is pure app-layer code (`pick/face.rs`). Zero-area and non-finite
  facets weigh nothing, and a face with no area left refuses rather than
  producing NaN.
- Curved walls offer the centroid only, with a tooltip noting that for a full
  bore this is the axis at mid-height.
- Every option sends the existing `SetWcs` command, so it is undoable like the
  vertex pick.
- With this, M13.4's picking and snapping items are done.

## M11.4: star plans smoothed at their morph seams: one decision (2026-11-06)

**Star plans (bore, rectangle, L) run `tidy::smooth_walk` after the morph**:
- threshold 4°, with margin under the 5° law;
- 24 passes;
- starting after the entry orbit, so the helix landing is never moved;
- points pulled back onto the centre area's boundary, so the walk cannot cross
  the wall.

Rectangle went from 110 to 0 breaks past 5°, and L from 202 to 0. Their
`KINK_RATCHET` entries are removed; removing an entry can only tighten the
check. L's peak load went from 15.4% to 15.7%, still under the 16.1% law.
Air, move counts, descents, rest and verify are unchanged. Still owed: the
narrow slot's 2 breaks in its entry orbit, which a grown plan leaves
untouched by design.

## M13.8: the spindle on posed rapids, and fixed workholding in the machine frame: two decisions (2026-11-06)

(1) **Posed rapids sweep the spindle band too** (`rapids_vs_fixtures_spindle`).
Law d2 and the post gate pass it. Upright rapids are unchanged.

(2) **Fixtures carry a `fixed` flag**; it defaults to false, meaning the fixture
turns with the part as before, and the machine table is always fixed.
- A fixed box is judged in the machine frame. Each sampled tool position is
  turned about the fitted rotary axis to stand the tool upright.
- Capsules grow by their distance from the axis times the rotary turn within
  the step, so the check never under-reports.
- The machine-frame verdict replaces the path-frame one only when every sample
  of a posed move transformed cleanly. A hit is therefore removed only where
  the machine frame PROVES the move clear. With no axis, or an `Unjudged`
  sample, the old result stands.
- `SetFixtureFixed` is undoable. The file writes `fixed` only when true, so old
  files load and re-save unchanged.
- Owed: the generate-time fixture check (`generate.rs`) still uses the old
  laws (as strict as before, never weaker), and there is no UI toggle for
  `fixed` yet.

## M11.3: a horizontal arc entry for pockets: two decisions (2026-11-06)

(1) **A switch, not a new entry type** (`Approach::arc_xy`, off by default).
- The chosen plunge, ramp or helix descends at the arc's start, so every
  descent law stays in force, including the non-centre-cutting fallbacks.
  A flat G17 arc then runs tangentially onto the first pass.
- The arc's radius and sweep come from the same Arc lead fields that
  Contour uses.
- The arc is proven inside the legal area by two polylines that bracket
  it: one inside the true arc with chord error ≤ 0.01 mm, and one outside
  it. Neither may cross a planned pass.
- If it doesn't fit, the radius halves, up to four times, and the notes
  say so. Past that, a named fallback descends straight onto the pass
  start.
- Zigzag pockets always fall back, because their rows start on the wall.
- Dropped: a separate "XY arc" entry type, which would have duplicated
  the descent choice.

(2) **With the switch on, the first ring starts at the midpoint of its
longest edge** rather than possibly a corner, so the arc has room. The
ring and its direction are unchanged. This also happens when the arc
then falls back.
- The file writes `arc_xy` only when on, and the fingerprint gains a
  byte only when on, so goldens stay byte-identical.

## M11.3: 3D ladders slow only the first diameter: one decision (2026-11-06)

**The 3D ladder now slows only the first tool diameter of cut after each
level's entry.** Before, it never slowed the cut: only the descent motions
were scaled.
- A per-level `settle` budget of one diameter is spent by the dive link
  and the first pass. Descent motions, later passes and hops don't spend
  it.
- On the plain ladder, a move that straddles the boundary is split at the
  boundary point. On the offset shell the whole chord is slowed
  (conservative: D to 1.5 D), since a split needs its own tip solve.
- Descending chords are slowed but don't spend the budget.
- A second dive resets the budget, because it bores full-width again.
- The engagement note is emitted once.
- With the limit off, output is byte-identical.

## M13.1: playback uploads only the dirty bricks: one decision (2026-11-06)

**The cut layer tracks which bricks changed, and a picture sends only those
bricks' texel runs.** Release bench: 2,024,224 bytes per picture became
56,872, about 35x less.
- The field marks a brick dirty at its single write site (`claim_record`),
  only when a value actually changed.
- `pack_cut_patch` builds the texel runs through the same `cut_texel` that
  `pack_cut` uses, so the two cannot disagree.
- A whole upload is sent for a session's first picture, after a backward
  seek (checkpoint restore), when the patch is as large as the layer, or
  whenever the eye isn't sure what is resident.
- The eye refuses a patch that doesn't fit before writing anything.
- A frame the UI skipped is carried in the next patch.
- Tests check that the patched layer equals a full repack byte for byte,
  forward and after backward seeks.

## Release 0.7.0: three decisions (2026-11-06)

(1) **Cut now, from a frozen main.** The user asked for a dist release at a
convenient test point. The point chosen is the moment every in-flight
worktree landed (face snap, star-plan smoothing, fixed workholding, pocket
arc entry, 3D first-stretch, dirty-brick upload): all of the day's user
reports are on main together, and the freeze gate ran every crate, the UI
suites, clippy and all three heavy lanes green (debug 1595 / 0, ui 298 / 0).
No new agents were started during the freeze.

(2) **Minor bump, 0.6.0 -> 0.7.0.** Per AGENTS.md the version stays 0.x.0
until the clean-room audit; 108 commits with a project-format change (v42 ->
v49, older files load) is a minor, not a patch. Same shape as v0.6.0: the
bump and the notes in one `chore(release)` commit, the lock sync in the
next, a local `v0.7.0` tag, the portable zip under `dist/` (gitignored).

(3) **Local only; the push is the user's.** `release.yml` publishes on a
`v*` tag push, and local main is hundreds of commits ahead of origin. The
session builds and packages but does not push; the user gets the zip path
and the exact push command. A `TESTING.md` hand-test list ships in the zip
and at the repo root, aimed at the day's reports.

## M11.5: the open Contour's band, extensions and sentence: two decisions (2026-11-06)

(1) **The viewport fills the band the open pass sweeps**, built from the SAME
`open_run` the generator uses (lengthened by the approach's `ext_in`/`ext_out`,
then swept by the tool radius), so fill and path cannot disagree. A refused pass
shades nothing. The leads are not in the band, as a closed ring's region also
leaves its leads out.

(2) **The approach extensions apply to open runs** (`lead_ext::extend_open`):
the same straight pieces `extend_leads` lays, without the room law, since an open
run's ends are air. Both at 0 is byte-identical. The summary now says the pass
"runs {len} past each end of the picked edge's chain".

Owed: `material.rs` was 694 lines before this and is 720 now; split `region_of` /
`region_turn_of` out. The preview computes `open_run` twice (cheap; noted).

## M13.8: the generate-time fixture check on the workholding laws: two decisions (2026-11-06)

(1) **Generate runs the post gate's exact sequence** (`bands_vs_workholding` +
`rapids_vs_workholding` with the spindle, from `GenJob`'s new `workholding` and
`rotary_axis` reads collected on the caller's thread). The 2D arm was switched in
place. The rotary kinds verify through the 3D arm, so that arm's `VerifyContext`
now carries no fixtures/spindle and the same helper runs after `verify` - the
only visible effect is that fixture warnings append at the end of the list
there, as the 2D arm already did. Generate and post-gate verdicts are asserted
equal hit for hit.

(2) **A "Fixed (does not turn with the part)" check row on every fixture**,
through the undoable `SetFixtureFixed` command via the pending queue; the UI
writes nothing to the world. No snapshot changed.

Owed: the setup sheet does not print the flag.

## The release train: three decisions (2026-11-06)

(1) **Fixed cut dates, floating scope.** Two trains a week (Mon/Thu 12:00
local); a must that is not green 4 h before the cut slips to the next train,
never the date. Dropped: milestone-triggered releases, which is how 0.6.0 ->
0.7.0 took 108 commits.

(2) **At most three musts per train**, each a ROADMAP row flip or a tester-
visible fix, so the release notes write themselves and the gate stays
small. Nice-to-haves ride if green.

(3) **The cut is mechanical.** The 0.7.0 recipe is the procedure; a
`scripts/release.ps1` that runs gate -> bump -> lock -> tag -> zip in one
command is a 0.8.0 nice-to-have so the freeze window shrinks further. The
session never pushes; the push command is handed to the user with the zip.

## The swarf stamp flips hemispheres mid-program: a finding (2026-11-06, Prime Directive)

The mid-move pose law (M13.7, held patch) convicted the swarf goldens at move
399 with 2.92 mm of rest and no gouge. The diagnosis (numbers, not opinion):
- move 399 feeds the tip 6.0 mm (= 2r) with the ball centre pinned on the rim
  edge while the pose goes from (-0.9999, 0.003, 0.011), B = -89.35°, to
  (1, 0, 0), B = +90°: a 179.3° turn;
- at the lerped mid-pose the axis is upright and both the ball-centre gap AND
  the minimum flank-line gap are 2.9226 mm - the tool is off the blade;
- the rim ring's own steps (0.7-5.3° turns) read within the gate;
- 23 moves in SWA turn > 150°, all at the ring <-> ruled-raster hand-off at
  the x = 24 rim; four are exact 180° flips on consecutive 4-6 mm feeds.

Cause: `stamp.rs` forces the ruled pose into one deterministic hemisphere
(z-then-x-then-y positive) while the rim ring's lean law has no such rule and
lands on -X. A joint-interpolating controller swings the head end-over-end at
feed. This is (a) a real program defect, not (b) a verifier contract mismatch:
the flank discriminator does not hold.

Decision: the mid-move verifier law stays as written and lands TOGETHER with
the stamp fix (choose the ruled-pose hemisphere continuous with the pose held
coming in; the ring's lean pose adopts the same hemisphere). The swarf goldens
are the acceptance: zero turns > 90° between consecutive cutting moves, verify
clean under the mid-move law. Dropped: restricting f2 to ball-contact kinds,
which would have hidden a head flip.

## M11.3: one descent per level on the 3D ladder and the bore contour: two decisions (2026-11-06)

(1) **The 3D ladder's substituted dive takes the 2D pocket's `dive_point`
search.** Zigzag + Arc entry dived twice: the arc's lead room was blocked at
the corner pass start, M8.1's substituted dive landed in the floor's widest
room, and the chord from there to the corner crossed the planned rows, so the
link hopped and plunged again. The dive now lands on the pass start off the
wall, else the first along-pass point that links back at depth, else the room.
Result: one descent on every level of all 48 configurations (slab/boss ×
Zigzag/Waterline × four entries × three link sets), verify clean.

(2) **The bore contour's helix lands on the lead-in start, then along the
pass, then the room.** Only the Linear lead still re-dives: lead-fit shrinks
it to 0.25 mm and its start sits 4.5 µm outside the certified ring, so no
at-depth link to it is provable. That branch keeps its named second dive
under `plunge_law::guard` (a non-centre-cutting tool is refused by name).
Owed: a lead-fit that keeps the linear lead's start inside the disc, or a
`links_to` that accepts the lead's own certified segment. Dropped, on the
STOP rule: switching the bore's Plunge arm to `dive_point` moved two pinned
behaviours ("bores in through its floor's room"), and it was not a second
dive, so it was reverted rather than re-blessed.

## M13.3: themes resolved beside the exe: one decision (2026-11-06)

**The theme folder is found at runtime** (`ui/theme_dir.rs`): `CAMCRAFT_THEMES`
if absolute, else `<exe>/assets/themes` (the zip layout), else
`<exe>/../../assets/themes` (a dev run from target/<profile>), and the
compile-time `CARGO_MANIFEST_DIR` path LAST as the dev fallback only. The first
that is a directory wins. With none, the built-ins stand and the status line
says "no theme folder found beside the exe - the built-in themes stand" once;
a bad override is named ("CAMCRAFT_THEMES=<v> is not a directory; ..."). The
resolver is pure (env, exe, manifest, probe) and has nine unit tests. This was
the 0.7.0 packaging finding; 0.8.0's zip now reads its own themes.

## scripts/release.ps1: one decision (2026-11-06)

**The cut is one command**: `scripts/release.ps1 -Version X.Y.Z -Title "..."`
runs preflight (clean tree bar the release files, no existing tag), the full
gate (every crate, ui from crates/ui, clippy, the three heavy lanes), the bump
and lock sync (asserting the lock diff is version lines only), the two
`chore(release)` commits and the annotated tag, the release build, a
`post.exe --version` check, and the zip assembled exactly as release.yml does.
It prints the zip path and the push command and never pushes. `-DryRun` walks
every phase without changing state; `-SkipGate` / `-SkipBuild` exist for a
re-cut after a docs-only fix. PowerShell 5.1 syntax throughout.

## M13.7 and the swarf pose laws: four decisions, and a gate finding (2026-11-06, Prime Directive)

(1) **The mid-move pose law lands as written** (`verify/midpose.rs`): a move
whose pose changes along it is judged at interpolated poses - b2 sweeps each
interval under its mid-pose, f2 samples the ball centre along a leaning Feed.
Only pose-changing moves pay; constant-pose and upright moves are byte-identical.
A Plunge is excused by f2 (an entry claims contact at its end only; the first
draft convicted the correct contour5d bar at a plunge, which was the design
error, not a finding). This closes M13.7.

(2) **The swarf stamp keeps its hemisphere** (`stamp_link::ruled_sign`): a
ruling is a line, so the ruled pose takes the sign continuous with the pose
held coming in, else with the last leaning pose stated, and the old
deterministic rule only for the program's first posed move. A "ruled" contact
whose normal leans along the ruling by more than sin 10° is an edge, not the
flank, and falls to the lean law. Lying-to-lying turns: 180° -> 5.7°.

(3) **A pose turn past 30° happens in air, never on a cut** (`stamp_link::
link_swings`): a Rapid lift under the OUTGOING pose to the raster's retract
plane, then a Plunge under the INCOMING pose back onto the ball centre the cut
finished on (sphere invariance about the centre). `guard_turns` refuses by name
any cut pair past 30°. Blade: max cut turn 180° -> 18.7°, cuts past 90°
74 -> 0, at the cost of 172 air links (263 on the ladder). Dropped:
`radial_relink` (a radial-frame law - a lying tool's axial retract slides along
the flank and never reaches clearance), and a 90° guard (the cap-ring passage
is 120° by the 60° clamp).

(4) **Two test laws were edited, named**: `pivot5d::posted_centres` no longer
measures a Plunge's start station after a Rapid as a ball of the plan (links
and entries start in air); `ruling::swarf5d_balls...` skips a Rapid whose ball
rises to clearance + R. Every other posted ball, link plunges included, must
still lie on the plan.

**Gate finding (5):** the heavy envelope scan (pivot5d, full-tool sweep)
rejected this landing: the in-air link lifted the lying tool in world Z, and a
swarf tool's 60 mm flank, in contact along the curved blade, was dragged through
the curvature - posed gouge 2.59 mm against the plan's 0.096. The tip- and
ball-centre laws cannot see a flank sweep; the full-tool scan can. The retract
must follow the contact normal away from the part, swing in air, and re-enter
along the incoming normal. Nothing lands until that scan agrees.

Owed (M11.3 / M13.8): a retract-height lift or lead-out blend to cut the air
time; the plunge audit reading a near-vertical re-entry by tip column rather
than by the already-cut sphere (a non-centre-cutting tool could be refused
there); one ruled pose dips 4.9° under level at a rim column.

## material.rs split: one decision (2026-11-06)

**A pure move along two seams**: `material_region.rs` (`region_of`,
`region_turn_of`, the chain helpers) and `material_source.rs` (the per-kind
source-built region and hole rims), re-exported from `material.rs` so no caller
changed. 749 lines became 216 + 262 + 300. Proven by recombining the module
bodies (byte-identical to the original), `golden_cl`, the full app suite and
the UI suite.

## M13.9: the scallop law lives as a non-blocking, ratcheted verdict: three decisions (2026-11-06)

(1) **The ridge flank law is live** (`stock_sim/ridge.rs`, reach `band + 3·tol`):
a model point flanked by the pass on both sides within reach, covered by no band
contact and reachable by a tangent ball, is a scallop reading. Creases narrower
than the ball are excused. Its reading travels as `EnvelopeReport.scallop_mm /
scallop_at`, separate from `rest_mm`, so the Envelope verdict is bit-for-bit
the old law. The reach cannot see a stepover-4 cusp on r3 (feet at 3.606 vs
3.423 reach); the equivalence test runs at 2.8 and the ceiling is documented.
Widening the window admitted closed rings flanking a point by themselves (cone
apex, hill crown); the flank predicate needs "feet from two distinct passes"
before the reach can grow - owed.

(2) **A scallop over tolerance is `Warning::Scallop { at, mm, gate_mm }`, and it
does not hold the post** (`blocks_post` is false only for it). It is a surface-
quality defect, not a gouge or a collision (RECOMMENDED "M13.8 B" (3)); it is
shown on the op page and in the status line by its reading. Every other
warning kind blocks exactly as before. Dropped: ignoring the convicted heavy
tests (they already run under `--ignored`, so that would have redded the lane),
and loosening the gate.

(3) **Sixteen finish fixtures pin their readings as a ratchet**
(`SCALLOP_RATCHET` in finish3d.rs and flow.rs: 0.127-0.349 mm over the 0.123
gate; the dome flows 0.156 over theirs). Any rise fails. Two caps (hill contour
and project with ramp) were pinned by analogy to their hop twins and held, so
they are valid upper bounds, not measured readings. The four 5-axis ops in
`operations` at stepover 2.0 on an r3 ball read a 0.162 cusp and now carry the
note; `verifies_clean` there asserts no BLOCKING warning.

Owed (M13.9, the generator half): the waterline stepdown is the 45°-from-
vertical law (`2·sqrt(r·tol)`) and reads 2.6·tol on the dome's 64° ground - the
slope-aware ladder `Δz = sqrt(8·r·tol)·cos α_v,max` equals today's law at 45°
and changes ring counts on every dome fixture (re-golden them); the cos-law
rasters' over-reads (multidirection 0.349) are unexplained - look at
`scallop_at` on the partition border and the second pass's join rows.

## M11.4: growth revolutions land on their ring tangentially: two decisions (2026-11-06)

(1) **`rings::morph_rev` eases the last 15% of each growth revolution onto its
ring** (`LAND = 0.15`, a value- and slope-continuous cubic ease, monotone,
never outside the linear blend) so every revolution reaches its ring on the
ring's tangent, not on the spiral's pitch. The slot's two 5.01° breaks were one
vertex per level at the seam where the last concentric growth revolution hands
over to the first band revolution: the ring's 3.75° chord angle plus the 1.3°
pitch drop. Every fixture now holds zero breaks past 5°; `KINK_RATCHET` is empty.
Dropped: post-hoc `smooth_walk` over the growth (invisible to the walk's own
readings but one cell worse to the lift's re-walk, which refused the plan), and
a per-seam tangent arc (no room: the band's first step is microns).

(2) **A one-point plunge landing must clear the full rim** (`lift_link::
legal_xy`): two microlift returns ended in a 0.3 mm plunge onto the slot's corner
scallop (23° on the dexel), read as descents 4. The landing now requires
`stock_clear(t, rim + h)`, the same law the retract hops use. Descents back to 2.

## M13.1: the lathe sweep on the field, and what rotary still needs: three decisions (2026-11-06)

(1) **A lathe move is a revolved stadium, closed form** (`Sweep::Lathe`): for a
query at (rho, z), the distance is the point-to-chord distance in the (r, z)
half-plane to the nose-centre chord (r0,z0)-(r1,z1), minus the nose radius,
taking the minimum with the mirrored point (-rho, z) so a parting chord that
crosses the axis reads the whole kerf disc exactly. No sampling; it enters the
running-max cut layer like every other sweep. Convention: moves are the nose-
CENTRE path (M5.2 E) on a spindle along +Z; pose stamps are ignored because the
part spins.

(2) **Parity is against the meridian law, because the column engine has no
lathe reading.** `plan_program` refuses lathe and rotary on BOTH engines; the
turning branch is judged by `turning::revolve`'s meridian scan. So the oracle
is that closed-form law in the seam's height vocabulary: 67,440 cell centres
with 0 sign misses, 1,104 column tops within 4.2e-13 of the cap/end-face
formula (gate 1e-5). The column arm refuses by name (`LATHE_COLUMN_REFUSAL`).
The `plan_program` refusal is NOT lifted yet: routing the Turn family's document
verdict through the field eye needs the nose radius and the lathe frame carried
in the plan. Owed, with a blade-profile variant for groove/part/thread/form
(the nose-stadium under-claims those - ghost rest, never a hidden gouge).

(3) **Rotary stays refused by name until it has parity.** It needs: the rotary
axis in `SimOp` (the moves carry pose stamps only); a chord pre-pass that cuts
each station-to-station turn into sub-moves with the pose interpolated, at the
chord law `n = ceil(dtheta / (2·acos(1 − chord_tol / R_far)))`, each cut by the
posed `Sweep::Shanked` (one axis per chord: a chord law at chord_tol, not a
conservative closed form); and parity against `verify::posed_steel`'s radial
law, since the column arm refuses every posed move. Round 2 is on it.

## The swarf link retracts along the contact normal, and the column rapid law cannot see it: two decisions and a finding (2026-11-06)

(1) **A posed in-air link leaves and re-enters along the contact normal, never
on a Z lift** (`stamp_link::link_swings`, now reading the facets). The Z-lift
link was rejected by the envelope scan (RECOMMENDED "M13.7 and the swarf pose
laws"): under a lying pose the lift dragged the flank through the blade, a
2.59 mm posed gouge where the plan read 0.096. The link now reads the surface
normal `n` at the exit ball centre `c`, rapids under the outgoing pose to
`c + h·n` (`h` the plunge height the Z lift used to climb, walked out along the
normal in r/2 samples and stopping at the first that stands nearer the part than
the exit; of h, 2h, 4h the first whose flank clears by r), swings the pose at
that centre, and plunges back down the same normal onto the SAME ball centre -
centre invariance kept, `guard_turns` unchanged at 30°. In a bore (no plunge
height reachable) the farthest-standing air is taken; a named refusal only when
the normal finds no air at all. Posed envelope now equals plan exactly on both
swarf blades (0.0963 / 0.0957), 153 and 234 links at zero cut turns past the
guard. Dropped: retracting to the clearance plane along the tool axis (the axis
lies in the blade's plane on a lying pose - the same drag), and a world-Z lift
with a pose-first swing (the swing itself sweeps the flank through the part).

(2) **The verifier's column rapid law (d) convicts the fix, and the law is what
yields.** Every under-equator link retracts down-and-outward, so its start
column reads a surface top above it: a height field has no word for the air
under an overhang, and `rapids_in_stock` convicts by construction (RapidInStock
at 361, 388 in the debug band, ~14 more in the full band) on a flank the solid
scan reads clean. The law gets a second, solid-aware reading for POSED rapids
before conviction (the same samplers `hidden`/`probe::solid` already use for
overhangs), with two pinned tests so it is not weakened: a posed rapid through a
ledge's underside solid still convicts; a posed rapid in the air under the ledge
reads clean. Unposed rapids keep the column law verbatim - 3-axis verdicts must
not move. Dropped: standing law (d) down for multiaxis kinds (that is the
Revolve/Radial stand-down, taken only where the kernel asserts its own rapids'
safety; swarf's links are new geometry with no such promise yet), and skipping
rapids whose direction leaves along the normal (the direction is the path's
word, not the stock's - a law must read the stock).

Finding: a column model is the wrong eye for any posed retract. The overhang
backstop (M13.7 B) only ADDS convictions to the column law; this is the first
place it must also be able to ACQUIT one, and the acquittal must come from a
solid reading, never from the path's own description of itself.

## M13.1: the rotary chord pre-pass on the field, and why the refusal still stands (2026-11-06)

**`Stock::simulate_rotary` chords every turning move at the pose tolerance and
rides the posed sweeps** (`stock_sim/field_rotary.rs`): modal pose (the first
move's own; unstamped moves inherit the held pose, since the field reads `None`
as upright), a turning move split into `n = ceil(dθ / (2·acos(1 − tol/R_far)))`
sub-moves with `R_far` the spanning flank's farthest reach, tip on the straight
chord, pose the letter lerp at the sub-chord midpoint, one axis per chord; a
ball tool's tip shifted so the sphere centre is exact at both ends. Refusals by
name: degenerate axis, non-finite input, a turning arc, more than 2^16
sub-chords - never coarsened. Parity on a laid d20 bar with a half-ring groove
(690 sub-chords, 17 s debug): sphere-cut floor 272 tops within 1.48e-5 of a
dense independent sweep (bound 1.54e-5), zero sign misses outside the flute's
own displacement band - but the flute-cut flank is chord-law class (7.9e-4 at
tol 1e-4), not the 1e-5 class, because the flute above the ball stands on the
mid pose and is off by L·α up the axis.

**`plan_program`'s rotary refusal is NOT lifted** - the lift needs the app
fixtures' parity (never run), both consumers (`simulate_document`, `stock_view`)
routed through `simulate_rotary` (else the field eye cuts posed moves
un-chorded - the silent approximation the refusal exists to stop), a flute-
rotation bound (`α ≤ tol/L`) if the flank must reach the field's verdict class,
and the per-sub-chord cost measured on the 2,064-move Offset ladder. The rotary
axis on `Planned` was not plumbed either: dead code under a refusal. Dropped:
lifting with the chord-class flank (a two-signed error the verdict would
swallow), and a conservative closed form (no such form exists for a flank
sweeping a cone of poses). Patch held as tmp/fieldsweeps.patch with the lathe
half; M13.1 stays ⚠️ on the rotary side.

## M13.8: the setup sheet names each fixture's frame (2026-11-06)

**Every FIXTURES line ends with the workholding frame the verifier assumed**:
`fixed (machine frame)` for a fixture with `fixed == true` and always for the
machine table (a table never turns - `fixture::workholding_for`'s own reading),
`turns with the part` for the default. The two strings live once as
`setup_sheet::FIXED_WORDING` / `TURNING_WORDING`, read live through
`fixture::def_of`, so an undo of `SetFixtureFixed` flips the sheet back - the
test asserts the byte-identical sheet after undo. Dropped: a separate
WORKHOLDING section (the operator reads the fixture line once; a second table
restating it is the kind of crowding the sheet avoids), and a symbol column
(✓/–: not self-explaining on a shop print).

setup_sheet.rs (875 lines) was split first as a pure move - mod (164) /
sections (171) / operations (186) / heights (359: the per-kind height-field
match alone) / tools (66) - every `pub` path unchanged. No sheet goldens
exist, nothing re-blessed.

## M13.9: the waterline ladder reads the slope, with the 45° law as its ceiling (2026-11-06)

**The stepdown is per band, from the part's facet normals** (`finishing3d/
ladder.rs`, `levels()` moved out of params.rs): walking down from the top,
each level asks which facets a ring in the band `[z − Δz₄₅, z]` touches (a
facet with upward normal m is touched at tip-Z z when `z + r·(1 − m_z)` lies in
its Z range) and the shallowest writes `Δz = √(8·r·tol)·√(1 − m_z²)`. Asking the
widest band and taking its smallest answer is conservative. The 45° law
`2√(r·tol)` stays the CEILING: walls and 45° ground keep today's ladder byte for
byte (cone golden unchanged), the slope law only tightens. A facet whose own
step falls under tol/4 is a floor (one ring at most, leaves rest not a cusp)
and does not drive the walk. Dome waterline: 0.183 → 0 against the 0.123 gate
(levels 5 → 6); its ratchet entry is removed - it answers to the gate itself.

**Scoped to Waterline and Morph only** - the ladders that are the sole
finisher of shallow ground. Measured, not guessed: with the law on every
pattern the hill-project fixture ROSE 0.127 → 0.189, because the first crown
ring became smaller than the flank reach and the scan read the ring's own
inside as scallop (scan.rs's named owed item, now with a concrete
reproduction), while the denser rings only double-cut ground the raster had
already promised. SteepShallow, Blend and every raster/polar/shadow family keep
the split line. `steep_stepover` stated still outranks; MAX_LEVELS 8192 stays a
named refusal (a second one if the slope law would exceed it). Dropped: a
"scallop-exact stepdown" toggle (nobody wants a 1.5·tol cusp back; a correct-
by-default law needs no parameter), and a global α_v,max (coarser everywhere
the dome is not steep). Side effect pinned: center_cut_posed's convicted 5-axis
descent starts its band one rung lower (the first crown ring now sits 5.6° off
the apex). Multidirection's 0.349 still unexplained.

## M13.1: the machined mesh reaches the viewport and the pick (2026-11-06)

**The viewport's stock slot draws the marching-tetrahedra mesh of the
whole-program field view** when that view exists (Deviate armed, transport
down - the same `Arc<FieldView>` the STL export keys on), as a shaded stock
part through the existing pipeline; the GPU eye still paints over it when it
traces, the mesh is what stands when it does not (no eye, refused march,
headless). With no view, or the transport up (a playback view changes per
frame - never extracted), the slot draws what it drew before. The accessor is
`MeshCache::viewed(&view)` - read-only, never extracts; `MeshCache::get`
remembers a refusal per view so a per-frame reader never re-extracts a failing
one. `ui::machined` primes once when the whole-program walk lands and says a
refusal once on the status line. Dropped: a world-level `machined_mesh(world)`
accessor (the field view is UI-held state, not in the world) and a second
renderer for the mesh.

**Picking asks the mesh second**: a stock-bucket hit is re-asked of the
machined soup (`app::pick::soup_hit`, Möller-Trumbore in world space) - a ray
through machined-away air reports nothing, a ray onto remaining material
reports the stock with no facet (the mesh is no entity). Model hits keep
winning. Owed: lighting the hovered mesh facet (the highlight path reads
entity facets only) and deviation classes on the mesh (it paints as plain
material; the eye and the sheet keep the verdict colours).

## M13.7: the swarf pose never falls to upright under the equator (2026-11-06)

**Root cause of the 18 cap-row convictions - not the ruling and not the lean
law, but the stamp's contact band.** The ring rows that turn off the tube's end
columns onto the caps under the equator (ball centres z −4.6…−8.0) stand 12-31
µm past tangency (d = 3.012-3.031 for r = 3): inside the plan's 0.1 tolerance,
outside the stamp's 10 µm contact band, so `pose_law` read air, returned None,
and the modal rule `lean.or(Some(UP))` stated upright - a 60 mm flute 0.8 mm
inside the wall. Behind it a second defect: once those rows read as contact,
the lean law at rim edges and end columns leaned the overhang's normal 20-30°
UNDER the horizon.

**Three decisions (swarf kinds only; every other 5-axis kind byte-identical):**
(1) the swarf stamp reads contact to `max(10 µm, tol)` - the plan's own
tolerance, not a fixed band; (2) a lean-law pose is kept only if it is above
the horizon AND its flank proves in air (`stamp_link::flank_clear`, the link
law's own sweep reader walking the pose to the shell's exit at r − tol);
otherwise the station carries the RULING, level, signed toward the air side
where |dir·n| > sin 10° (cap face, rim edge) and by `ruled_sign` continuity at
the end columns, trying the other ruling end before giving up (`stamp_pose.rs`,
the law moved out of stamp.rs for the 400-line seam); (3) where no pose clears,
`GenError::Invalid("swarf pose at move N … refused")` - named, never upright in
the wall. Dropped: standing `UP` down only under the equator (the defect is the
band, the equator is where it showed), and widening the band to a fixed 50 µm
(a tolerance-blind number that would read air as contact on a tight plan).

Result: posed envelope == plan (0.0963 / 0.0957) on both blades, the full band
verifies with an EMPTY warning list, no refusal fires on the blade fixture,
and full-band links fell 247 → 86 (moves 3576 → 3093) because near-surface
hops no longer flip upright and back. The mid-move pose law (verify/midpose.rs)
lands with it: M13.7's owed item closes. Pinned: no swarf cut under the equator
is upright, no pose below −0.1737, every cutting flank ≥ r − tol from the exact
prism; a ceiling fixture's fallback states the level ruling; walls across both
ruling ends refuse by name.

## M11.5: boundaries read in the tilted plane, and the boundary group on the finish family (2026-11-06)

**A 3+2-indexed op resolves its area context in the tilt's frame** instead of
refusing: `Tilt::frame()` is taken (a non-finite letter refuses with the
collect job's own words), the stock outline and part silhouette are projected
over the local facets, the standing-material plane reads `material_overhead`
in the local frame with the L1 shift `run_job` uses, and every pick goes
through the selection walk with a projection door (`selection_geometry_in(..,
frame)`, `to_local` then XY) - the existing callers wrap `None`. The preview's
tilted arm runs the controls on the local region before `world_region`, so an
offset grows the shadow by the projected amount. Pinned: a tilted pocket with
a +3 offset equals the rotated flat pocket move for move; a NaN tilt under a
boundary refuses by name in generate, in `area_refusal`, and draws no preview.
Dropped: resolving in world XY and rotating the result (an offset in world XY
is not an offset in the tilted plane - the shadow is foreshortened).

**The boundary group now covers the whole 3D finish family** (every
`Finish3D` pattern) through `Family::Finish` and `finish_clip.rs`: the whole-
model path is generated as before and CLIPPED to the applied region grown by
r, minus excludes grown by r or the far side of an open boundary; cut moves
keep their inside pieces (arcs chorded only where they cross), re-entry is
rapid to clearance, traverse, vertical plunge at plunge feed; a path left with
no cut refuses by name. Default controls give the byte-identical path
(`golden_cl` 23/23 unchanged). Dropped: regenerating the finish inside the
clipped region (every pattern would need its own region law; clipping the
whole-model path keeps one law for all seventeen and the verify judges the
result exactly as before).

**One list of the kinds that refuse, each with its reason** (`area::
area_unsupported`; `area_applies` is its `is_none`, read by `build`,
`EditOperationParams` and the UI group alike): Slot and Circular (authored
endpoints / centre and radius), Trace and Engrave (they ride the outline as
the path), Chamfer2D (the cone lies on the wall), the hole kinds (a hole
list), Deburr (the model's edges), the 5-axis/rotary kinds (mesh-driven, a
moving axis), turning (the turned silhouette). Owed: a clipped-entry ramp law
for a non-centre-cutting ball (today `center_cut_guard` refuses by name rather
than ramps); Face's open-boundary band preview under a tilt draws the local
turn on the world shadow (approximate drawing, exact cut); Trace/Engrave could
take containment through a `ToolOn` native later.

## M13.1: the rotary lift - the eye routes, the verdict refuses (2026-11-06)

**Gate finding (main session, same day), resolved: the parity TEST's height
law, not the field pass.** The heavy test's Offset arm read "field 16.0 vs law
3.31" at column (−1.75, −5.25): along that column the field and the radial law
agree in SIGN at all 68 probes (steel −16..3.2, air 3.3-6.2, steel 6.3-7.0,
air 7.3-10.2, steel 10.5-10.9, air 11-13.8, steel 14-16) - the ring at
ρ = 5.2 bores a TUNNEL under the standing cap, and the old `law_top` returned
the sweep's lowest reach (3.314, the tunnel floor) while the field's `top` is
the top of remaining steel (16.0, the cap). Unlike quantities; the eye's
picture (cap standing) was right. The law's column top is now MARCHED from
the stock's own uncut top through the swept union to the first steel
(sphere-traced with a 1e-3 floor - pure inside-tracing stalled beside a
grazing side wall - and a bisected exit to 1e-7; a floor thinner than a cell
is a sliver and skipped); a column the sweep never reaches must stand at its
uncut top within the same bound. Bound unchanged. With that: Parallel 1,196
sphere-cut tops worst 1.57e-5 / 0 of 7,023 sign misses, Contour 276 standing
tops exact / 0 of 6,940, Offset 440 standing tops exact / 0 of 7,020 - all
three kinds lifted (`rotary_kind_lift`), `ROTARY_KIND_UNMEASURED` kept as the
landing refusal for a future kind. The eye already routed only lifted kinds
(an unlifted kind fails `plan_program` and the pre-existing "traced playback
refused - the sheet stands" fallback draws), now pinned. Cost at the verdict
class: 17 / 204 / 171 s release for Parallel / Contour / Offset; at the eye's
class (cell/4) 2.5 / 8.7 / 6.4 s. The heavy lane's budget is ~14 min now,
stated in its ignore reason. The parity fixture moved to
tests/common/rotary_bar.rs (pure move).

**Three decisions.** (1) The field EYE (`stock_view::field_view_with`,
`stock_play::cut`) routes every rotary op through `simulate_rotary_slice` at
`rotary_pose_tol(cell) = cell/4` - the field's own arc chord law, one chord
class throughout; a playback slice prepends a standing rapid at the held pose
so its first move still turns (whole == two slices, cell for cell). (2) The
column VERDICT (`simulate_document`) refuses every rotary program by name
(`ROTARY_VERDICT_REFUSAL`): its height field is blind under the equator, and
routing it through `simulate_rotary` would read the hidden half silent-clean -
the posed clause's own prohibition. The refusal text names the eye's chord
class and the flute flank's L·α error honestly. (3) `plan_program`'s lift is
PER KIND (`rotary_kind_lift`): Rotary Parallel lifted - parity on its own
program 1.47e-5 on 1,001 sphere-cut tops, 0 sign misses on 7,025 cells, 4,442
sub-chords in 12 s release; Rotary Contour and Offset stand by name
(`ROTARY_KIND_UNMEASURED`). Contour measured 92,727 sub-chords / 179 s release
at the verdict class, and a standing bar has no sphere-cut column from above
(the rings cut the flanks) - its height class needs a radial reader or a laid
fixture; Offset's parity and eye-class cost are unmeasured (~1.9 ms per
sub-chord says minutes on the 2,064-move ladder). Dropped: lifting on the
bar fixture's parity alone (the brief's own law: parity per kind on its own
program), and a single global lift. Owed: the Contour/Offset measurements,
the flute-rotation bound, and the parity suite's bar fixture moved to
tests/common (459 lines, over the 400 law). Pre-existing, found: the laid
fixture's stock entity carries a rotation and `stock_view` refuses rotated
stock before any cut - tested by name, not fixed here.

## M13.3: code signing and the installer-vs-zip decision - both, Inno Setup, per-user, signing env-gated (2026-11-06)

**Both: the portable zip stays the release, the installer is additive.**
The user base is machinists testing drops; the zip is what they unpack on
a shop PC without rights, so it stays first-class and unchanged. The
installer (`scripts/installer/camcraft.iss`, built by
`scripts/installer.ps1`) is packed from the SAME staged dist tree, so the
two can never diverge in content. Cost to change: delete two scripts and
one workflow step.

**Inno Setup, not WiX or MSIX.** One `.iss` text file, preinstalled on the
`windows-latest` runner, free for any use. WiX v4 needs its own CLI and XML
authoring for a layout this small; MSIX cannot be installed at all without
a signature, which we do not have. Cost to change: a WiX rewrite of ~80
lines if an MSI is ever required by a site's deployment tooling.

**Per-user install by default, all-users as an option.**
`PrivilegesRequired=lowest` + `PrivilegesRequiredOverridesAllowed=dialog`:
no administrator prompt, `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\camcraft`, and the first
page offers Program Files for those who can elevate. Same reasoning as the
zip: a machinist's PC rarely grants admin.

**Signing is environment-gated and never blocks.** `scripts/sign.ps1`
signs with `signtool` (SHA-256, RFC-3161 timestamp) when
`CAMCRAFT_SIGN_THUMBPRINT` or `CAMCRAFT_SIGN_CERT_PATH` +
`CAMCRAFT_SIGN_CERT_PASSWORD` are set and prints "unsigned: no certificate
configured" otherwise; configured-but-broken fails the cut. CI reads
optional secrets `CAMCRAFT_SIGN_CERT_BASE64` / `CAMCRAFT_SIGN_CERT_PASSWORD`
(the thumbprint route has no store on a runner). No certificate is owned,
so every release remains unsigned until one is bought; the path is in
place. Dropped: signing the Inno-embedded uninstaller via the `SignTool`
directive (untestable without ISCC and a cert here; one-line follow-on).

**`-Installer` is opt-in on the local cut, required in CI.** Locally a
missing ISCC.exe is a named skip so the cut never depends on a tool the
build machine may lack; the runner image ships it, so there it is an
error. Not validated here: the `.iss` compile itself (no Inno Setup on
this machine) - the first tag push after merge is the test.


## M11.4: arc output for the HSM adaptive plan - four decisions (2026-11-06)

**Gate finding (main session, same day), resolved: the READER, not the fit.**
The heavy lane's full-resolution report read the load past the 14.6 % + 10 %
law on every fixture (bore 17.1 %, rectangle/L 16.4 %, slot 17.1 %) where the
chord plan read inside it. Measured: the 49 kept arcs stay within 0.0025 mm
radially (max sagitta 0.0028), and the arc plan re-chorded at the reader's own
pitch reads the same 17.06 % - so the geometry had not moved. The load
reader (`quality::measure`) walks a path at its chord tolerance with the
contact window facing `p − prev`, the walked chord, which lags the true
tangent by half the chord's angular step; arcs were walked at 0.263 mm, 2.2×
coarser than the plan's 0.118 mm chords, so the window turned backward by
3.2° instead of 1.4° at the helix peak and over-read standing stock the
cutter never touches (max_deg 47.5° → 50.0° = 15.38 % → 17.06 %, monotone in
pitch). Two changes: on an XY arc the window faces the circle's tangent at the
sample (pitch-independent), and the reader's chord tolerance is the plan's
own sagitta (`PLAN_SAG` = 3e-4) so an arc is read as finely as the chords it
replaced. The arc plan now reads the chord plan's exact numbers: 15.4 % at
D/120 on all four fixtures, 19.51 % at D/60. Dropped: pitch-matching alone
(16.04 % at D/120 but 20.26 % at D/60 - grid phase), and loosening the law.
Noted, out of scope: the same chord-direction lag inflates CHORD-plan readings
by ~1° at the plan's pitch (true load likely ~14.7 % against the 14.64 %
target); a heading averaged over adjacent chords would remove it but
recalibrates every law.
## M11.4: arc output for the HSM adaptive plan: four decisions (2026-11-06)

(1) **One fitter, the ring budget.** The adaptive plan's cutting chords ride
`arcs::fit_arcs` - the pocket/contour family's own fitter, not a second one -
at `ARC_FIT_TOL * 0.25` (RECOMMENDED "The ring arc-fit budget": the plan's
walk is already a tessellation, so the fit may not stack a second sag on
it). `PocketParams` carries no chord tolerance, so the budget is the
fitter's own constant quartered, the same number the waterline ring gets.
Only the passes are fitted: microlift returns, pass links, descents and
leads are posted by their own laws and never pass through the fitter.

(2) **Every arc is proved inside the area or refused by name**
(`machining2d::arc_proof`): the horizontal arc entry's law (`descent_xy`) -
the inscribed chord fan at sagitta <= 0.01 mm and the circumscribed tangent
polyline, both proved chord by chord inside the cutter-centre area by
`chord_clears` (walls and islands alike). A refused arc hands back exactly
the plan vertices it covered (the fitter's endpoints are always plan
vertices, so the walk's cursor is an index into the pass).

(3) **The crossing law and the kink law are proofs too - the fixtures
demanded both.** The bore's first fit raised two verifier crossings: the
plan's revolutions part from their rings by microns at the landing seams,
where an arc's few-micron bow off its chords crosses the neighbouring turn
- no region test can see it. So the posted path is held to the verifier's
own law (a) on the TRUE arc (its bracket's chords against every other feed
chord, the orientation predicate at a shared depth, grid-bucketed); an arc
that crosses is given up and the walks are posted again, three rounds at
most, then every arc still standing is dropped. And the rectangle, L and
slot read 2 / 60 / 8 in-cut breaks past 5 deg (worst 10.65) at D/60 with
the fit alone: a short, marginally curved run fits a circle within the
budget whose end tangent stands degrees off the next chord. Law: fitting
never adds a kink - at each junction the turn between the arc's tangent and
the neighbouring chord may not exceed the turn the plan's own chords made
there. Every held fixture is back at zero breaks. Cost: the kink law refuses
most arcs over the morph spiral (rectangle 672 of 1115, L 1988 of 3310, slot
372 of 741); the concentric revolutions and bands keep theirs. Readings at
D/60, before -> after: bore 6650 -> 1200 moves (86 arcs), rectangle 36118 ->
18372 (882), L 87764 -> 51788 (2636), slot 42892 -> 23280 (690); loads bore
19.51 -> 19.14 %, rectangle 19.51 -> 20.26 % (grid phase on the arc's
samples, inside the 10 % law; `PLAN_TOL` names the arc fit in its margin),
L and slot unchanged. The island and channel fall back to Offset rings by
name (owed round 6) and are untouched.

(4) **No new parameter.** The 2D family exposes no "arc output" toggle
(waterline rings are fitted by strategy, not by a field), so the adaptive
op fits by default like them; a user wanting chords has no plausible reason
the rings' users lack. Dropped: refactoring `descent_xy::arc_at` onto the
shared bracket (its lattice-snapped fan would have to be re-proved byte for
byte against the xy-arc goldens - a follow-up, not this lane). Owed: the
kink law's refusals over the morph spiral - a fit that reads the plan's
local curvature (a tangent-constrained biarc) would keep them.

## M13.1: the playback jump cuts checkpoint to checkpoint, and the CPU eye leaves the UI thread (2026-11-06)

**Where the jump's time went** (dense bench, 4,267 moves, release): the
worker's own overhead was ~0.65 s of a 25.9 s jump - adaptive 15 ms chunks of
2-4 moves (the field's per-batch brick walk ran ~1000× instead of once per
checkpoint stride), a snapshot every 50 ms (cut-layer clone, `take_dirty`,
`pack_cut_patch`) for pictures the jump overwrites, and the dirty ledger's
per-cell insert for a picture sent whole. The pre-worker 12.4 vs 14.8 s were
measured on a faster machine; the comparable figure is the ratio to a direct
seek, 1.03 → 0.99 after.

**A jump (target farther than the field's 1,024-move batch) cuts checkpoint
to checkpoint with the ledger off** (`FieldPlay::set_batched`, `Stock::
set_dirty_tracking`), re-reads its target every stride, and publishes whole
layers at a 1 s floor with the landing published once; jump mode holds until
it lands and resets the ledger there so the next play's patches are relative
to that picture. Decision: 1 Hz progress pictures during a jump rather than
one publication at the end - a 12-25 s jump must not be a frozen stock (the
user's original complaint); ~16 full packs per jump, in the noise. Dropped:
shrinking the chunk timer (it was the chunking itself that cost), and
publishing the landing only.

**The CPU fallback eye runs on a worker** (`ui::trace::cpu_eye::CpuEye`:
latest-wins job slot, single output slot - PlayWorker's pattern). `StockEye::
march` on the CPU path only takes a finished picture (matched by camera key
and field, or an older view of the same session so a slow march still lands),
requests the newest if none is in flight, and returns pending; `prepare` keeps
what stands - the sheet or the machined mesh before the first picture, the
last finished picture (with its own camera and mvp) after. The shell polls
with a redraw per `about_to_wait`, so the picture is picked up next frame.
`trace/eye.rs` was split: pure geometry to `eye_geom.rs` (400-line law).
Pinned: the first `prepare` returns pending under 250 ms, the picture arrives
on the worker, a moved camera keeps the last picture; the CPU and GPU eyes
still paint the same pixels.

## M13.5: axial drilling on the lathe, and the C-axis letter gate (2026-11-06)

**The Drill kind is admitted on a lathe, not a new Turn-family kind**
(`KindInfo::admits(machine)`: the family table plus one per-kind exception,
read by `family_gate`). A new OpType would touch the registry, ordinal,
labels, DTO and UI for no new behaviour - the mill's cycle vocabulary
(G81/G82/G83/G73) IS the lathe's for a hole on the spindle axis. On a lathe a
Z-hole Drill passes `drilling::axial_doors` before the mill's cycle kernel,
verifies under `Mode::Revolve`, and gets the meridian verdict
`drilling::axial_warnings` (hole recognition re-run on the part: no modelled
hole on the axis, drill wider than the bore, bottom past the floor or exit →
Gouge at the cycle's first move; a blind floor left short → Envelope rest).
Refused by name: a hole off the spindle axis (that is F2's cross drill or the
C-axis end hole), past the bar's far end, a drill wider than the bore. The
ribbon still hides the Drilling section on a lathe (section-level law; the
command door is the law) - follow-up: `panes.rs` reads `KindInfo::admits`.
Limit named: every shipped `.cps` is a 3-axis mill post; the cycles post in
the mill dialect (X0 Y0 Z R). A lathe post script (G83 Z R Q with G98/G99) is
its own row.

**C is pinned, not faked through A/B.** `operation::rotary_gate::
rotary_letter` matches the kernel's fitted axis line against the mounted
machine's rotary inventory (`AxisLimits.axis`, M3.3 D): A/B on a table
trunnion admitted, no rotary on that line refused naming the line and the
inventory, letter C refused "(M13.5 B)". Why: the stream's pose law
`cl::axis_to_angles` renders a stated tool-axis VECTOR as [A, B, 0] - a
direction has two degrees of freedom and C is the one it cannot carry - so a
part turning about the spindle would post as A/B swings, a silent wrong
program. What the lift needs: a stated rotary angle on posed moves beside the
tool axis, the C word in the posts, and `machine::check_document`'s letter
gate reading it. Found in passing: the program sim judges against EVERY
model in the document (two bars in one world made one's top disc the part
surface inside the other's bore) - fixtures hold one model per world; a 4 mm
drill in a 16-gon 4 mm bore is a sliver gouge to any height field (the
fixture models the bore at r 2.05, 64 segments).

## M13.5: the first lathe post, fanuc-lathe.cps (2026-11-06)

**Diameter programming on the kernel's meridian, read axis-agnostically.**
The turning kernel's frame puts the meridian on world +Y for an upright bar
(`radial = u × (1,0,0)`), not X; the post reads the radius as the signed
single in-plane coordinate (origin-relative) and emits X = 2·r. A move with
both X and Y off the axis is off every meridian: "milling work", refused by
name. G18, G02/G03 with I/K radius-value increments (a YZ-stated meridian arc
flips handedness viewed as ZX from +Y).

**0i-T face cycles G83/G84/G85, not G81/G82**: public T-series references
list only those three as face cycles, and on T controls G98/G99 mean per-
minute/per-rev, not retract level - so G81/G82 would be a mill word in a
lathe program. Q peck in whole microns, P dwell in ms; one positioning rapid
only when the chain is not already there. **G97 + G50**: `G97 S M03` from the
stated rpm, `G50 S<machine max>` once per program when stated; G96 only on a
stated SurfaceSpeed parameter (none exists yet - the post never invents CSS
from an rpm). **G99 feed per rev** = mm/min ÷ rpm at 4 dp; no rpm → refused.
**G32, not G76**: the stream carries no thread cycle record; the kernel's XY
half-turn arcs about the axis (constant radius, antipodal ends) post as `G32 Z
F<lead>` with lead = 2·Δz. G76 waits for a thread cycle record in the stream.
Refused by name, counted once per reason: off-meridian, posed A/B/C, a cycle
off the spindle axis, back-bore, an XY arc that is not a thread half-turn, a
half-turn with no lead, feed per rev without rpm, rpm over the machine's max.

**A mount does not auto-switch the post.** `posting::default_post_for(Kind)`
exists and the picker filters by the mounted machine's kind (mill-turn lists
both), but `LoadMachine` does not re-point the document's post - that is its
own command and decision (the Setup pane may offer it). Dropped: a silent
switch on mount (a document's post is the user's word). Goldens under
`crates/app/tests/golden/nc/fanuc-lathe/` (facing, profile rough+finish,
groove+part, axial drill); the facing fixture is not warning-silent (its own
RapidInStock/Envelope notes ride as comments) and `program_of` asserts the
script itself refused nothing. Every mill golden refuses through the lathe
post by name (conformance).

## M11.4 C round 6: late leads re-marked on the re-ordered stock; the island's hops are a corner piece's leading graze (2026-11-06)

**Built, the recorded step**: `LinkLaw::late` (adaptive/lift_link.rs) - when
`high()` refuses a late piece, its lead is re-marked with `walk_marks` on the
stock as it stands at that point in the order; each trailing graze run over
the bite is joined to the piece's cut, the lead trimmed to the air before it,
and a straight return then a retract-plane return retried. All laws kept (hop
budget 8, kink, load, no self-crossing, descents, the "no worse than the
spiral" keep law reading the joined graze). It converts trailing grazes (piece
200: 90-point lead at 17.0° → 13 points at 13.5°, hop → high; lap piece 31:
40.5° → 14.0°, straight return).

**Finding - the island stays on the named ring fallback.** Its 9 hops are the
SW-corner piece of every lap (debug grid pieces 197..237 at (5.47, 7.9)): their
24.7 mm leads graze 20.0-20.5° for the first 22 mm and the last 3 mm holds
stock inside the r5 tool disc, so no rapid column and no plunge landing
exists - the graze is AHEAD of the only air, and a leading graze cannot join a
cut that runs forward from the piece. Cause: `depends` reads the last 3 mm of
a lead (`LEAD_READ`) while `high()` descends along as much of it as it needs,
so the piece that clears the lead's first 22 mm is not yet cut. Tried and
dropped: reading the WHOLE lead in `depends` - hops 9 → 1, but it forces the
spiral's order back and the plan fails the air budget (16,943 mm out of cut
for 4,344 in cut, 3.9× over 1.5×). Next: a lead-scoped dependency (only the
pieces overlapping the ramp `high()` would take, not the whole lead), or a
corner landing off the lead (a disc-clear point in the cleared area within
RAMP_RUN of the piece, descended as a chord). Patch held with the arcs
(tmp/island-r6b.patch, on the hsmarcs base); the heavy lane has not read
`late` on the lifted plans yet - due at close-out.

## M11.4: the Pocket3D port of the HSM planner - the 2D plan inside the 3D level law (2026-11-06)

**Each Z level's closed cutter-centre region goes to the 2D planner unchanged**
(`machining3d/hsm.rs::plan_level` builds a one-level `PocketParams` and calls
`pocket_hsm::adaptive_passes`): spiral, growth rings, microlift returns, hop
budget, kink law and arc output are the one planner; the level ladder, the
computed islands and rest/mask intersections, the erosion by r + leave, the
entry (the plan's bore spot or narrowed helix radius rides a per-level params
copy so `descent::helix` closes on the plan's seed) and the verify stay the
3D op's own. The planner needed only visibility (`adaptive_passes`,
`EntryRoom`, `Joins`, `fit_proved`, `crossing_free` as the runs-returning form
of `post_crossing_free`, `microlift::link_at` with a hop plane + feed) and a
`what` naming the area in its refusal sentence. One port defect the fixture
found: an HSM level's unjoined pass must take the retract hop, never
ROUGH3D's keep-down chord (it slotted at 100 % D through unplanned stock).

**The choice is the existing `PocketStrategy`, not a new enum**: Pocket3D
already carried it - `Adaptive` = the HSM plan per level, `OffsetRings` = the
pre-port ring tiling at the load step (every earlier 3D Adaptive op,
move for move); the fresh default `Auto` is unchanged, so the goldens are
untouched; digest word 4 so an old Adaptive op goes Stale once (the 2D
precedent). A level the planner refuses cuts rings and names its Z in the op
summary ("… - Offset rings cut the level at Z -10.000 instead"); the rest
pass and offset shells keep rings, said once. Dropped: a separate
`Strategy3D` (a duplicate of an existing choice) and a migration of old
Adaptive ops to OffsetRings (the 2D precedent did not). Readings on the
60×40 slab with a 12×12 boss, D10, D/60: Z −5 open level 9,202 moves, 441
proved arcs, 19.1 % D, 0 breaks, clean; Z −10 island level refused by name
(the plan crosses itself at (−19.00, −2.13)) and cut with 443 ring moves,
clean. Owed: the rotary wrap ladder keeps rings under Adaptive (channel
levels the planner refuses); the arc crossing law on a 3D level is proved on a
proxy posting of the level's walks, the verifier's crossing law remains the
backstop. The agent ran out of its box before the app and ui suites - the
main gate measures them.

## M13.5 follow-ups: the ribbon reads the command door's word; the Setup pane offers the matching post (2026-11-06)

**One visibility law, in app**: `Section::kinds_for(machine)` filters a
section's kinds through `KindInfo::admits` - the same word the command door
reads - and `shown_for(machine)` is the sections whose `kinds_for` is
non-empty, so a lathe's ribbon now shows Drilling beside Turning with only
the Drill kind in it. The UI (`panes.rs`: ribbon plan, enabled, tips, gate
note, the tree's retype menu) reads only that; no `family().admits` copy
remains in UI. Pinned: `shown_for` and `kinds_for` agree on every machine;
`Drilling.kinds_for(Lathe) == [Drill]`; the ribbon snapshot goldens did not
move.

**The post is offered, never switched**: `posting::post_offer(world)` is
`Some` only when the document's post does not serve the mounted machine's
kind and the post is not a user file; the Setup pane's post section draws a
status banner ("the current post serves a mill; switch to Fanuc Lathe?") with
a Switch button that queues the EXISTING `SelectPost` command - undoable, no
new command. Pinned: no banner on a mill; mount a lathe → the post stays,
the banner names the lathe post; switch → Named("Fanuc Lathe"), banner gone;
undo → back, banner back. Dropped: auto-switching on mount (a document's post
is the user's word) and a modal prompt (a banner is Fusion's grammar for a
recoverable state).

## M13.8: the fixture sweep walks the mid-move pose law, with a proven swing (2026-11-06)

**Finding first**: the fixture sweep did not sample only a move's ends -
`posed_steel` already cut each posed move into 0.5 mm intervals - but its
growth's swing term was the larger of the END poses' angles from the
midpoint, i.e. it ASSUMED the letter lerp never strays farther between the
samples than at them (true on an A-only geodesic, unproven on a combined
A+B lean), and it was a private copy of the interval law. Now `posed_steel::
sweep` walks `midpose::intervals` - the one law the part's solid (b2),
contact (f2) and posed-rapid readings walk - and each `Interval` carries a
PROVEN swing: each RS-274 letter turns the axis at most a radian per radian,
so from the interval midpoint every pose inside lies within ½·(|ΔA|+|ΔB|+|ΔC|)
of the midpoint pose; the capsules grow by `travel + reach·swing` and the
machine-frame rotary growth takes the same bound. The enclosure is
continuous between samples, not sampled. On A-only (4-axis) paths the bound
equals the old chord angle - no golden gained a warning; unposed and
constant-pose moves are byte-identical by construction; non-finite moves
still fail closed. Pinned: a feed whose end poses (−40°/−140°) clear a clamp
but whose lerp sweeps the holder through it mid-travel → FixtureHit once;
the clamp moved out of the cone → clean; under a 90° index the fixed block
(machine frame) is hit by the upright holder and the turning block (part
frame) is clean. Verify time on the rotary fixtures unchanged (11.5 → 11.3 s,
32.9 → 32.8 s). This closes M13.8's last owed item; the off-diagonal head-
before-table reading (rotary.rs law c3) remains the part law's only.

## The Phase 1 leftovers audit: M1.4 flips, the rest re-home their debts in M13.11 (2026-11-06)

Audited (read-only, with evidence in code and ledger) the four ⚠️ Phase 1
rows. **M1.4 flips to ✅**: every bullet done, no owed prose. **M1.1, M1.3 and
M1.5 stay ⚠️** but no longer carry buried debts - each leftover now has a
tracked row, M13.11 "Phase 1 leftovers": G41/G42 cutter-compensation output
(`onRadiusCompensation` is never called; the only Phase 1 gap that touches
the G-code - not to be dropped), mesh repair (weld, holes; only `open_edges`
counts them today; cross-ref M12.1 healing), IGES import or a recorded
won't-do (refused by name since M1.1, owned by nobody), cross-entity open-run
stitching and facing rows honouring holes (M1.5's two real limits; the other
"known limits" there - material side, ambiguous extensions, Trace on open
runs, id re-keying - are decisions that refuse by name, not debts). Struck as
done: the 2D pocket's spiral/ramp/helical entries (the Entry3D family since
M5.1 H, helix the default since M11.3, the arc entry in M11.3). Dropped:
declaring the two M1.5 limits won't-do (facing rows that ignore holes is a
machining gap, not a design choice).

## M13.10: the area-control leftovers close (2026-11-06)

**The clipped finish's re-entry ramps along the kept chain** under the
guard's `entry_ramp` retry (`finish_entry::ramp_into`): the ramp starts on
the solid's top plane at `drop/tan(ramp_angle)` along the kept run and
descends vertex for vertex over the chain, so every ramp point stands
vertically over a kernel-certified centre - air by the 3-axis tangent law,
inside the centre area because the chain is; ramp feed = plunge feed (the
ring ladder's own choice). A chain shorter than the ramp, or rising above its
line, keeps the plunge and `center_cut_guard`'s named refusal ("even with
ramped entries"). A centre-cutting tool keeps its plunge, byte-identical.
Dropped: the 2D helix/`dive_room` law (it certifies against a level plane,
not a surface) and re-generating the finish inside the piece.

**Trace and Engrave take the group through `Native::ToolOn` / `Family::
Ride`**: containment and offset move the ride about its own chain
(inside/on/outside = 15/20/25 on the block, On move-identical to native),
includes and excludes shape the ring before containment as Contour's do; an
open boundary and an extension refuse by name (no ride edge to bound).
Defaults byte-identical (goldens 23/23). **Face's band under a 3+2 index is
built in the tilt frame and projected out** (`region_turn_of` returns the
local region + plane; `machined_footprint` projects through `world_region`),
so the preview is the cut - the overrun lands along the frame's u in world,
not 2r along world X. finish_clip.rs split for the 400-line law
(finish_entry.rs). M13.10 closes; M11.5's pointer stands.

## M13.11: IGES import waits for the M12.1 kernel - a decision, not a debt (2026-11-06)

**IGES is refused by name until the B-rep kernel lands (M12.1), and the
decision is recorded so no row carries it as an open debt.** IGES carries
trimmed NURBS B-rep (entities 128/144) exactly as STEP does; today's STEP path
rides truck's tessellation and every toolpath still reads a mesh, so an IGES
reader would have to be either a second tessellating B-rep reader (a third
crate's robustness and licence to audit, for a format the user base has not
asked for since M1.1) or a port of the M12.1 kernel's own reader before that
kernel exists. The clean diagnostic stays ("IGES is not supported yet - export
STEP or STL"); the M1.1/M1.3 rows point here. Dropped: a mesh-only IGES
importer (IGES mesh entities are rare in the wild; it would read almost
nothing real) and silently accepting the file (never). Revisit the day M12.1
reads STEP through its own kernel - IGES is one more entity table on the same
topology.

## M13.9: the rasters' over-read was the march's blind skip probe; a closed ring never flanks its own inside (2026-11-06)

**Not a partition, not a join row - the march's skip phase.** `ParallelMulti`
has no partition (both directions cover the whole shallow bounds). After a
run ends the march probed blindly at 4·δ₀ (4.38 mm); the strict tangency
leaves a fold gap of r·|Δm| between every pair of tessellated facets (0.2 mm
on the r20 dome, 0.47 mm between the hill's 9° bands), so a line is ~1 mm
runs with hairline gaps, and a probe landing in the next gap - or a
bisection converging on a later transition - dropped whole runs: the dome
Parallel's worst column had its nearest rows 3.39 mm = three stepovers
apart. The 0.349 "multidirection" reading was the single-Parallel path (that
test judges both). The skip phase now seeks from `tol` on a doubling ladder
up to the old cruise (open-air cost unchanged); the spiral family keeps the
blind probe, pattern-gated, because the ladder found an inner-turn piece on
the hill spiral and its newly flanked column read 0.156 against the 0.144
pin - a ratchet never rises. Readings (gate 0.1234): dome Parallel 0.349 →
0.125, dome multi 0.182 → 0, dome scallop 0.156 → 0.104, hill contour 0.231
→ 0.143, hill project 0.127 → 0, hill radial 0.127 → 0.126, ramp hill 0.297
→ 0.153, tilted ramp 0.170 → 0.170, dome flow 0.156 → 0. Ratchets lowered
or removed accordingly (dome scallop, hill project, the caller-less "open
dome geodesic" entry, the flow table); `finish3d_radial_dome.cl` re-blessed
(1958 → 1736 moves: one-transition brackets stop fragmenting runs).

**The ridge flank law needs feet from two distinct passes.** `ridge::
closed_ring_ids` names each closed iso-Z ring (its plunge and retract ride
the ring's id); `Flank::add` refuses an opposite pair from one ring - a
closed ring's own inside is one graze, rest's jurisdiction, not a cusp.
Pinned on the hill's crown ring (radius 1.62 < reach: 0.194 → ≤ gate) while
two rings at the ceiling spacing still convict. What remains over the gate
(hill 0.126-0.154, tilted shelf 0.170) is the strict tangency's fold annulus
r·Δm on coarse meshes - ground the march refuses by law, not spacing; the
next owed item is a kernel decision (edge-resting centres vs the belt's gap
law).

## M13.11: G41/G42 cutter compensation - the part contour under control comp (2026-11-06)

**`Compensation { Computer, Control }` lives on the contour's `Approach`**
(default Computer: every golden byte-identical), not a new OpParams field -
it rides links, undo, the project file (additive key) and the digest (a byte
only when Control) with no construction-site churn. **Control emits the PART
contour** (the region at stock-to-leave) under `G41/G42 D<tool>` on the
lead-in and `G40` on the lead-out - the variant G41/G42 exists for; the
"wear" variant (centre path, near-zero register) needs a register convention
per shop and is owed. The CL carries a `CompSpan` per ring (`cl/comp.rs`:
side, radius, first/last, the programmed moves) beside the cutter-centre
moves, which stay the sim/verify truth. **The lead law**: Control needs a
linear or perpendicular lead-in AND lead-out ≥ r, a closed ring, and the
seam re-seated mid-run on the longest edge so the control's engage offset
equals its cancel offset - the tool then runs exactly the proved centre
moves. Refused by name: arc/tangential/no lead, a short lead, tabs, corner
blends, overlap, keep-down links, open contours and runs, a 3+2 tilt. The
stream carries `COMP LEFT|RIGHT <µm>` / `COMP OFF`, the engine fires
`onRadiusCompensation` and refuses a script that lacks the hook the moment a
COMP record arrives; Fanuc writes the words, Haas/Mazak/Sinumerik/Heidenhain
and the lathe post refuse by name; every refusal blocks the gate. D = the
tool number (the library carries no offset register). Owed: the wear
variant, the other mill dialects, a generator-side concave-corner-vs-tool
check (today only the control's interference alarm catches it); contour.rs
stands at 415 lines (split owed).

## M13.11: cross-entity open-run stitching (2026-11-06)

**A second walk after the per-entity one, entered only for multi-entity
picks.** The runs the per-entity walk leaves are walked again across every
picked model (`stitch_cross::stitch_across`), welded on the same 1e-6
lattice in the op's frame (world XY, or the M11.5 tilt frame) with either
endpoint of a candidate matching (the flipped-continuation law), and
oriented by the same shoelace canon - so a rim split across bodies is one
ring (or, under an open boundary, one open chain), labelled "the stitched rim
of 'a' and 'b'", its picks consumed so the routing, chips and notes read as
the single-entity case does. A selection on one entity never enters the
second pass: single-entity output is byte-identical, goldens untouched.
Refused by name: a junction three runs meet at ("meet 3 ways at (x, y) - a
ring across models must meet end to end, one way on"; the picks spell two
rings and a guess gouges) and a composed ring whose Z span exceeds one weld
step ("lie on different planes"). Dropped: a looser plane tolerance (nothing
in the pick law names one) and resolving forks by the shortest ring (a silent
choice). Pinned: two half blocks butted at x = 0 with six rim picks → one
40×40 ring whose top-level cut equals the one-block cut move for move; the
fork and plane refusals; the open chain; create/set-geometry/undo/redo.
stitch.rs split (gather_runs / walk_ring / compose_ring; run_out.rs a pure
move). Found, not fixed: `contour_depth` fails closed below the top level on
two touching bodies (coincident seam walls) and says so in the notes -
tracked as its own row.

## M13.11: facing rows honour holes - Lift by default, Through as the explicit legacy (2026-11-06)

**The rows never change; the holes clip them.** The facer still clears the
bounding band (full-span rows, X overrun - `face_band_sane`'s doctrine); the
region's voids (holes less any island nested in them) are grown by the tool
radius - the pocket's cutter-centre construction - and each row is clipped
against that set by a half-open parity walk; the pieces are cut in row order
and a bridged hole is crossed by the facer's own level link (rapid up to
clearance, across, plunge at plunge feed). A row-end reversal or blend rides
only when both ends are whole. **`Face.holes` = Lift (default) / CutAir /
Through**: Lift is the only law safe without knowing whether a void is a bore
or a boss; CutAir cuts across air holes and lifts over islands (an island is
a void under material standing above the cut plane, `material_source::
standing_above`; with no outline to read, every hole is lifted and a note
says so); Through is the M1.3 band serpentine, byte-identical. Default Lift
costs nothing: no golden carries a hole and a hole-free region is byte-
identical under every law (tested). Refused by name: two bridged holes
closer than the tool ("the strip between them would stay standing").
Perpendicular leftovers beside a hole that only a tangent row could reach are
NOTED, not refused - the wide-stepover precedent; refusing would make the
default refuse every square hole. Dropped: snapping extra tangent rows into
the band (changes the row set, helps only rectangular holes); a tangent
cleanup ring around bridged holes is the follow-up if users want them faced.
Staged facing repeats pieces and links per level. The project file writes
`holes` only away from Lift; the digest likewise, so cached legacy faces keep
their digest.

## M13.11: mesh repair - weld by spatial hash, planar hole filling, one command (2026-11-06)

**`geometry::repair::weld` merges vertices by spatial hash within a stated
tolerance** (Teschner et al. 2003; pipeline per Botsch et al. 2010 ch. 8):
cell = tol, 27-cell probe, the FIRST occurrence is the representative so
nothing moves farther than tol; tol = 0 is a bit-exact merge. Collapsed,
zero-area and duplicate (either winding) triangles are dropped, vertices
compacted. **`fill_holes` is Liepa 2003's planar case only**: boundary loops
from odd-count edges walked as reversed half-edges (consistent fill winding),
a Newell best-fit plane, simplicity proven, ear clipping in the plane. A
non-planar loop (> 5 % of its bbox diagonal), a self-crossing or degenerate
loop, a non-manifold edge or vertex, an unclosed chain and a loop over the
budget refuse by name - a non-planar hole is NOT bridged with surface the
user never drew (Prime Directive); Liepa's full minimum-weight triangulation
was dropped for that reason. `open_edge_count` is the diagnostic, now in
geometry (the sim's twin). **`RepairModel` is the only door** (weld then
fill at construction, one undo unit over `UpdateModel` restoring the exact
previous facets and revision; `FromModel` stock copies follow); it refuses a
closed model ("nothing to repair") so no no-op history entry exists, and it
never runs on import. The Model page carries the verb (tolerance, largest
hole, the last report). Pinned: a split-seam cube welds 9 → 8 vertices;
a missing face returns as 2 triangles with signed volume +1; a 1000-edge
hole over a 256 budget refuses and fills at 1000 (cone volume π/3); NaN/
inf/collapsed soups never panic. Dropped: the sim's lattice-1e-9 weld as the
repair's law (bit-exact indexing after an explicit weld is honest about
what moved).

## M13.11: contour depth on touching bodies - the union of the picked bodies (2026-11-06)

**The depth ladder and the verify read a multi-model selection as the union
of its bodies**: each body is sliced on its own and the sections are united
by the 2D boolean law (`slice::material_above_of`, the same union the region
builders apply to picks across entities), so two models butted face to face
cut every level the one block they stand for cuts, move for move. One body
keeps the plain slice byte for byte (`bodies.len() < 2` short-circuits in
geometry, motion and sim), and a self-touching single shell still fails
closed at its seam with the floor note - fail-closed stays for genuine
non-manifold input. Two decisions: body identity comes from the pick's
ENTITIES (facet index ranges on the flat material list), never from shell
connectivity - two welded bodies share rim edges and cannot be told apart in
the soup; and the verify learned the ranges through a `verify_bodies` entry
rather than a new `VerifyContext` field, leaving its 35 construction sites
and every one-body verdict untouched. Pinned: the two-body ring cuts Z 10 and
Z 0 exactly as the one block (same moves, lengths, extents, warning count,
no "levels below skipped" note); the merged single mesh still stops at its
top level with the note.

## Release 0.8.0: cut early to park a stable build (2026-11-06)

**The user asked to park** ("we are starting to run out of credit. Its time
to wrap up the current phases and park it at a stable dist build"), so 0.8.0
is cut on Fri 2026-11-06 instead of Mon 2026-11-10 12:00. The train's law
holds - a release is a cut of what is green - and the cut carries the 0.8.0
musts plus nearly all of 0.9.0 and 0.10.0 (all gated, heavy lanes included).
The last full gate (gate 9) ran on the exact tree that is tagged, so
`release.ps1` runs with `-SkipGate` rather than repeating the 50-minute gate
on identical bytes. Two in-flight agents were stopped rather than gated
(the lathe lift on the field and a headless binary per crate); neither left
code on main and both stay owed in ROADMAP. The 0.9.0 and 0.10.0 rows keep
their dates for whatever lands next. Dropped: cutting at Monday's date
(holding a finished build three days for a calendar), and cutting before the
last four changes were gated (they were done; one gate covers them).

## 0.8.2 hand-test fixes: edge loops, the Selection height offset, Outside containment, Circular from the selection (2026-11-07)

From the user's hand-test of 0.8.0 on testdata/models/Milling-test.step (a
60×50 block, Z −5..20, a round recess cut from the top to Z 0; the ~2500 mm²
face at Z −5 is the underside - not a shoulder, which changed the diagnosis).
(1) **Shift+click takes the whole face loop** an edge lies on (the boundary
picker's `extend_to_loop`, reused), Ctrl+click toggles one edge; the Edges
mode shows the hint and the open-run refusal says how to close the loop -
the multi-select existed but nothing taught it. (2) **The "weird height" was
the From combo carrying the old offset**: "Bottom of stock +18.7" (= Z −5)
became "selection bottom +18.7" (= Z 13.7). Switching to Selection now
starts at offset 0 - the picked face IS the floor. Dropped: converting the
offset to keep the same Z (the user picked the face to mean its Z). (3)
**Containment On/Outside no longer machines a hole of the part**: the part
was subtracted from the selection BEFORE containment grew it, leaving only
the recess, which containment then grew. Now the pocket kinds hand the whole
outline to the boundary step, only OUTER edges grow, holes stay as picked,
then the part is subtracted and only the pieces the band past the outline
touches are kept. Found, owed: Outside alone leaves a band exactly one tool
wide (2D Adaptive refuses it by name, "no room for an entry"), and 2D
Adaptive on an extended band planned for over 6 minutes in debug - tracked.
(4) **Circular fits its circle to the selection** (`circle_fit::
circular_fit_of`: the region's outer contour - or its single round hole -
accepted when every vertex is within 0.01 mm of the mean radius about the
area centroid); a non-round selection refuses with the deviation and where;
no selection keeps the typed circle byte-identical. The boundary group stays
refused for Circular (one change at a time).

## Issue #12: a whole-part Pocket source clears the stock around the part (2026-11-07)

Closes "M11.4 A+B" (6). A 2D Pocket / 2D Adaptive / 2D Offset whose
source is a whole part (Entity, not the stock) with a setup stock now
clears the stock's outline minus every part section standing at the
ladder planes - the M11.4 island law the picked pockets ride
(`area::whole_model_pocket`). A part covering the whole stock outline is
refused by name. Kept: a Stock source, the stock entity itself, and a
model with no stock set up still read as "the volume to remove" (no
stock means no "around"; the tilt suite pockets such models).
Dropped: refusing every whole-model pocket (breaks that documented
contract) and the old reading (it machined the part).

## Issue #42: the gouge law reads Area-mode moves along their whole length (2026-11-07)

The reported 0.30 mm "gouge" at the block corner was the pinning test
sampling a true G2 (R 5.000 about the corner) along its chord. The
generator was right, and the test now samples arcs on the arc. The real
hole was in the verifier: law (b) read a straight move only at its
`to`, so a G1 chorded across a convex corner with both ends R off the
part passed (1.46 mm in for the arc's chord, 0.30 mm in for a tangent
G1). Chosen: in `Mode::Area` (the pocket family, where every region
edge is a wall or an island), every chord is measured against every
boundary edge by segment-to-segment distance. Kept: `Mode::Boundary`
(Face, Contour, Thread, Drill, Bore) on the old law points, because a
Face's rows cross the face's open edge by design and the whole-chord
reading convicted them (two area_controls tests). Dropped: the
whole-chord law for every mode, and point sampling along the move
(a step size only shrinks the miss, it never closes it). Owed: a
Contour G1 cut across a convex corner of its own wall is still read at
its endpoint only; that needs open-edge awareness and has its own issue.

## #40: the control-comp room law - inside corners and necks refused by name (2026-11-07)

Closes M13.11's owed "concave-corner-vs-tool check" (`machining2d/contour_comp_room.rs`,
run in `push_span` on the programmed ring the walked centre ring pairs with). **Chosen:**
(1) every edge must hold the offset trims of its inside ends, r * tan(turn/2) apiece
(the controller's line-intersection rule) - a sharp inside corner between long edges
passes, a facet run tighter than r is named as an arc of radius `len / 2 sin(phi/2)`;
(2) every fitted G2/G3 that curves toward the tool must have R >= r; (3) the ring alone,
offset by r toward the tool, must stay one ring (`Region::offset`), the gap named at the
midpoint of the closest pair between the split pieces. **Dropped:** the brief's flat
"edge shorter than r beside an inside vertex" - it refuses legal 90-deg corners whose
edges are between r and 2r and passes 150-deg turns it cannot cut; the trim rule is the
exact one. Rings the centre offset drops (an island the tool cannot reach) are not
judged - computer comp skips them too. Two bosses closer than 2r (Outside merge) stay
on the existing seam / distance / `is_sane` refusals.

## #43: the Boundary-mode gouge law reads straight moves against WALL edges along their length (2026-11-07)

`sim::verify::section::wall_gouge`, after #42's Area reading. **Chosen:** in
`Mode::Boundary` every straight cutting move is also measured along its whole length,
but only against wall edges: every edge of the model section (material on one side by
construction), and a region edge when the section holds a probe 0.05 mm off its
midpoint on either side (a Face rim over air is open, a Contour outline where the part
stands is a wall). With no model there is no material to probe: a move that properly
crosses a region edge is read as overrunning an open rim (the Face row - a wall is never
crossed by a legitimate move) and keeps the endpoint reading; a move that crosses none
answers to every region edge. Arcs keep the law points (their chords sag inward).
**Dropped:** a new `Mode` variant or a `VerifyContext` field naming open edges (touches
every constructor and kind for what the section already knows); the plain whole-chord
reading of every edge (convicts Face, #42's finding). Known limit, model-less only: a
straight move that CROSSES a wall of a 2.5-D contour (centre inside the material) is
excused by the crossing rule, exactly as before this change. Note: the solid law (b2)
did NOT catch the pinned chord with the mesh in hand either - the tangency law was the
only line, so the fix is not redundant.

## #13: 2D Adaptive refuses a channel too long for one growth spiral, at once and by name (2026-11-07)

`motion::machining2d::adaptive::budget`. **Cause:** the extended Outside band round the
Milling-test part is a 14 mm annulus (D10): its centre area a closed ~4 mm channel ~270 mm
long, no star cell, so the growth rings (`grow`) slit it open and grow ONE spiral along
the C. In a 4 mm channel each revolution held the load at 0.12-0.37 mm of front advance
(~1.5 mm^2 of ~1100 mm^2 a revolution) while re-walking the whole cleared outline (rings
of 250-500 vertices, up to 7 trials on a 1.3 M-cell raster): margin 1.0 spent 140 revs in
9.8 s release and went Short, 1.6 the same, 2.4 runs toward MAX_REVS 800 - about a minute
in release, many in debug. The work grows as L^2 with the channel length. **Chosen:** (1)
an up-front least-work law - channel length `L = area / (2 clearance)`, fronts each
travelling L/2 at no more than the step cap (1.5 optimal widths) a revolution over rings
averaging L: `L^2 / (2 cap)` in tool radii, refused past 2000 r (the 60x14 slot needs
~110 r, the user's band ~3400 r, a fat 200x150 island pocket ~1600 r); (2) a running net:
the summed length of every revolution tried, all margin attempts, refused past 30 000 r
(the slot spends ~5800 r). A refused plan has no passes; `pocket_hsm` names it ("the HSM
plan is refused: the area is a channel 13.9 mm wide and ~269 mm long ...") and the Offset
rings cut the area - the existing fallback law, now 0.06 s instead of minutes.
**Dropped:** a wall-clock deadline (non-deterministic: a plan's outcome would depend on
machine load); making the ring walk incremental (the real speed-up, but a rewrite of the
trial walk across grow/raster - not a 40-minute change; open as follow-up if the
adaptive is wanted on long bands); refusing via `Err` (the op would fail instead of
falling back, against the named-fallback law). Known limit: a very large island pocket
(lb past 2000 r, roughly 250 x 200 mm and up with D10) now falls back to Offset rings
up front where it used to plan slowly.

## #45: setup navigation, operation labels and order (2026-11-07)

**Chosen:** Keep the entity `Name` as the stable command key, store a separate
editable label and an optional within-setup order on each operation. Existing
projects retain name order; the first drag assigns positions to that setup's
operations. The browser keeps one flat Operations section, sorted by setup
rank and then operation order. Its existing Setups row appears only after a
setup exists; setup navigation stays in the browser, with no new toolbar cell.
Dragging across a setup boundary is refused; changing setup remains the
existing explicit property edit. The project format advances to v50 so older
builds cannot silently discard the new program order and post a different sequence.
**Dropped:** Mutating the entity `Name` on rename (older undo commands would
lose their target), and a UI-only sort (the displayed order would disagree
with posting, simulation and rest machining).

## #36: the march rides convex folds on the edge - drop-cutter edge contact closes the fold annulus (2026-11-07)

**Chosen: edge-resting centres for convex folds between shallow facets**
(`finishing3d::edge`), the ball-against-segment arm of the drop-cutter
vertex/facet/edge decomposition (Yau, Chuang & Lee 2004; Hwang & Chang 1998).
`build_sups` keys shared edges by exact vertex bits and keeps, on one of the
two facets, the neighbour's sky normal when the fold is convex; `support_at`
and `support_grad` add the edge drop (closed form in the edge's vertical
plane) as a candidate, admitted only when its contact normal lies on the arc
m1→m2 and judged by the same exact `ball_clear`. Concave folds, mesh rims,
shallow-steep edges and knife rims (a cap's base disc only looks shallow once
its normal is flipped skyward - the arc test refuses it; without that test the
morph rode the cap's rim down to the 45° clamp) keep the strict tangency.
Release readings (gate 0.1234): hill contour 0.143 → 0, hill radial 0.126 → 0,
hill spiral 0.144 → 0, the three hill "with ramp" entries → 0, ramp hill
0.154 → 0, dome multidirection 0.125 → 0; tilted ramp 0.1698 unchanged - a
single plane, the hop path reads the same, so its cause is the shelf's high
rim corner, not a fold. Ratchet table down to that one entry.
`finish3d_radial_dome.cl` re-blessed (1736 → 1874 moves; plunges 246 → 150:
chords no longer break at the crests, the extra feeds are the chord law
refining across the edge arcs). Dropped: the belt's gap law (a slack in the
facet test - forgives a sunk centre on a convex fold, the corrugated belt's
0.0317 mm bite); vertex contacts (the vertex gaps are points the readings no
longer see; owed only if a fixture shows them).

## #17 (M11.3): the swarf pose-law leftovers - link count, re-entry audit, rim dip: five decisions (2026-11-07, Prime Directive)

Readings on the motion suite's debug blade (`swarf_pose_continuity`, the
16 x 6 capped tube; the "172" of the M13.7 entry was an earlier landing's
count, 153 / 234 after the normal-retract fix on the app fixture):

| run | air links before | after |
|---|---|---|
| swarf, debug band | 68 | 34 |
| ladder, debug band | 106 | 51 |
| swarf, full band | 93 | 55 |
| ladder, full band | 145 | 84 |

Lowest stated pose: -7.3 deg (swarf) / -9.4 deg (ladder) under level before,
level (-1e-17) after.

(1) **The curvature fit reads one sheet at a time** (`curv::CREASE_COS`, a
neighbour whose normal turns more than 60 deg off the facet's is across a
crease and is skipped). The first cause found: the fit's neighbourhood is
1.5 x 4 mean edges (27 mm on the blade) and its 64-neighbour cap fills in
grid order from -x first, so every facet on the -x half of the tube took
the -x cap's normals (90 deg round the rim) as curvature along the ruling,
read unruled, and lost the swarf pose to the lean law mid-line: a 75 deg and
a 105 deg air link on every raster line. Now all 192 tube facets read ruled.
Alone it moved the count nowhere (68 -> 71: the mid-line pair became a
line-start pair at the rim); with (3) and (4) together 34 (the hold in air took it to 23 but was dropped, see (3)).
Dropped: nearest-first neighbour selection (would make both ends unruled
near the caps symmetrically - still the crease read as curvature); a
narrower radius (changes every flow fixture's field for no law).

(2) **`ruling::analyze` keeps one verdict per facet** - a facet the fit
could not answer pushed nothing, shifting every later facet's `ruled` flag
and indexing the direction scan past the end (a panic the crease fix
exposed: the flat caps' fits went singular once their tube neighbours were
excluded). It now pushes `false` ("no claim").

(3) **The swarf hold** (`stamp_pose::hold`): wherever the ball is in
contact but the ruling does not speak (a level floor, a rim or cap edge -
the stations the lean law answers), a pose that would turn past
`LINK_TURN_DEG` off the held one keeps the held pose, if that pose is a
lean, not under level, and its flank is proved in air (`flank_clear`, the
stamp's own proof). The ball cuts the same surface under any pose about its
centre; only the flank could differ, and it is proved. This removes the rim
station's turn at the raster ends and most cap-ring turns. NOT in air: a
first draft also held the pose on the exit rise (a Feed off the part) and
reached 23 links, but the app blade's verifier read that posed feed in air
as an Envelope rest of 14.8 mm (`swarf_generates_blade_lying_axes_and_
verifies_clean`, `advanced_swarf_adds_the_coarse_rungs`); a feed in air
keeps the modal upright, so each raster end still links once on its exit
rise. Owed: let the exit rise be a Rapid (or let the posed contact law
excuse a feed that leaves contact along the normal) and the raster-end link
goes too. This is the "lead-out blend" option of the owed line in its
simplest form - no turn at all; dropped: a retract-height lift (it shortens
each link but cuts none), and a blended pose ramp over the line's last
stations (a turn on a cut, which the guard exists to refuse). Not proved
here: the heavy pivot5d envelope scan (release lane) - the hold's flank
proof is the same proof every swarf station already carries, but the scan
is the judge of record and must run at the next cut.

(4) **The rim dip is fixed, not bounded** (`stamp_pose::level_ruling`): a
ruled contact read off a facet's EDGE projected the ruling into the contact
normal's plane, which leans along the ruling by up to sin 10 deg, so the
pose dipped by as much. The facet's own plane holds the ruling exactly;
where that reading is level or above and its flank clears, it is the pose.
The pinned bound in `swarf_pose_continuity` tightens from -0.1737 to
-1e-9 (level). This also lets the hold (3) qualify at the cap rings, where
the dipped lying pose used to fail the hold's not-under-level test.

(5) **The re-entry plunge audit reads the already-cut sphere for a ball
tool** (`plunge_law::reenters_cut_sphere`, `first_solid_plunge_as` /
`audit_as` with `ball`, wired through `center_cut::guard_shaped` and
`plunge_solid::guard_posed` with `tool.kind == BallNose`). The owed line
said the audit read a near-vertical re-entry "by tip column rather than by
the already-cut sphere (a non-centre-cutting tool could be refused there)":
the defect is the false refusal. A link's re-entry whose incoming pose
lies within the core's 30 deg cone of the contact normal is axial, and its
tip column was never cut down the NEW axis (the pose turned), so the column
law convicts it - though the ball only retraces its own retract and ends on
the centre the last cut finished on. Acquitted only when all of: a posed
Plunge; its end ball centre equals the last cutting move's end centre; the
first rapid after that cut starts at that centre and ends where the plunge
starts (both within 1e-6). Every other plunge, and every non-ball tool,
keeps the tip-column reading verbatim (`swarf_reentry` pins both arms and
two misses). The retract rapid itself stays the verifier's to judge (the
posed rapid solid law) - the audit acquits only what that rapid already
answers for. Dropped: acquitting any plunge ending inside an earlier ball's
sphere (a plunge from elsewhere sweeps unretraced material on its way).

## #18 - M11.2 verdicts made final: oblique entries and Heidenhain vertical arcs stay chords: three decisions (2026-11-07)

(1) **Heidenhain keeps vertical arcs as 1 um chord fans - final.** The
brief recommended native XZ/YZ arcs; dropped for a hard reason. The
post is the TNC's DIN/ISO mode (M3.3 B), not plain language, so the
CC / C DR+/- spelling does not apply. The public TNC 620/640 DIN/ISO
manuals say I/J are the absolute Cartesian circle centre in the
working plane (not start-relative increments). An arc with axes off
that plane (`G2 Z.. X..` under a Z tool axis) appears only as the
spatial-arc case, with no stated rotation sense for the ZX/YZ view and
no rule on axis order. A native arc would therefore guess a direction
that can mirror, and a mirrored vertical entry gouges. The fan is
exact to the 3-decimal word resolution, so nothing is lost but block
count. `arc_planes::heidenhain_rides_its_vertical_arcs_as_chords_and_
never_switches_plane` now pins both planes: on the circle, the arc's
own sweep sense (G3 in XZ, G2 in YZ) and the exact end. Reopen only
with a documented sense rule, or with a KL-mode post (M3.3 B).

(2) **Oblique entry chords stay a chord fan with one note - final.**
G17/G18/G19 are the only arc planes ISO 6983 / RS-274 define. A tilted
working plane per entry (G68.2 / PLANE SPATIAL) changes the post's
frame for a single lead move, and every dialect would need its own
tilt-and-restore block pair and its own refusal paths. That is not
cheap and not safe for one entry arc. Already pinned by
`vertical_arc_entry::an_oblique_first_cut_stays_chords_and_says_so_once`.
The near-axis snap (M11.2 B (4)) still turns the cases that are
within tolerance of an axis into true arcs.

(3) **Finding, filed separately: the Heidenhain XY arc centre words.**
The post writes `I`/`J` as centre-minus-start increments (Fanuc
semantics). The same manual reading says this mode's I/J are the
absolute centre, so XY arcs that don't start at the centre's origin
offset may be read wrong by a real TNC. That is outside #18's scope and
golden-locked, so it is left for its own issue (#49, P0: wrong
output) and not changed here.

## #49: Heidenhain DIN/ISO XY arcs post the absolute centre, in its own block (2026-11-07, Prime Directive)

Primary source, read in full (not a summary): HEIDENHAIN "TNC 640
User's Manual, ISO programming", NC software 340590-07 / 340591-07 /
340595-07, ID 892909-25, English, 9/2016, hosted at
content.heidenhain.de (`.../TNC640/34059x-07/diniso/892909-25.pdf`).

(1) **I/J are the absolute circle centre - the post now says so.**
p. 260 "Circle center I, J": the centre is entered as "the Cartesian
coordinates of the circle center in the working plane", stays in
effect "until a new circle center is programmed", and is relative to
the last programmed position only "if you enter the circle center
with incremental coordinates". p. 128: an incremental coordinate is
written with G91 *before the word*; this post writes G90 in the
preamble and never G91. The manual's own full-circle example (p. 267:
`N50 I+50 J+50`, start `X+0 Y+50`, `G02 X+0`) is only consistent with
absolute centres. The old output (centre minus start, Fanuc's
increment) was therefore wrong on every XY arc whose start is not the
work origin - a real TNC would cut about a different centre, i.e.
gouge or refuse on its 0.016 mm circle check. Fixed: I/J are the
CL centre shifted by the work origin, exactly like X/Y (`wo`).

(2) **The centre gets its own block before the G2/G3.** p. 261:
"Before programming a circular arc, you must first enter the circle
center I, J. The last programmed tool position will be the starting
point of the arc"; every example in the manual writes `N.. I.. J..`
alone, then `G02/G03 X.. Y..`. Writing I/J inside the G2 block (the
Fanuc shape) is not documented for this mode, so it is not relied on.
Considered and dropped: keeping one block (fewer lines, smaller golden
diff) - undocumented, and the manual is the only authority we may use.
An arc reaching the post without an XY centre is now refused by name
(counted warning) instead of posting a G2 without one.

Golden diffs: only the I/J words moved (to a preceding line, absolute
values); X/Y/Z/F and every other block are byte-identical.
Pinned by `heidenhain_arc_centre::heidenhain_arc_centre_words_are_the_
absolute_centre` and `..._shifts_with_the_work_origin` (CW and CCW
arcs ~100 mm from the origin, so absolute and incremental differ; the
centre rebuilt from the words as the manual defines must equal the CL
centre within 3-decimal resolution, start/end on one circle), plus the
updated `arc_planes` and `conformance` goldens.

Left open (not this issue): the manual writes signed words (`X+25`)
and `N` block numbers with `*` terminators; the post's unsigned,
unnumbered style is the house choice locked since M3.3 B. Whether a
real TNC accepts that style is a separate question.


## #50: Heidenhain DIN/ISO block form, program frame and drilling - from the manual (2026-11-07, Prime Directive)

Primary source, read as a PDF (not a summary): HEIDENHAIN "TNC 640
User's Manual, ISO programming", ID 892909-25, English, 9/2016
(content.heidenhain.de `.../TNC640/34059x-07/diniso/892909-25.pdf`).
The issue named four items; reading the function overview turned up
four more words the control reads as something else, so all eight are
fixed here. Each was "would the TNC reject or misread it?":

(1) **N block numbers and the `*` terminator - fixed.** p. 130: "A
machining program consists of a series of NC blocks ... The TNC numbers
the blocks"; every program in the manual is `N<n> words*`. Unnumbered,
unterminated lines are not this mode's block form, so not relied on.
Chosen: N10, step 10 (the manual's own programs); a program long enough
for N to reach 99999999 (the end block's number) is refused by name.

(2) **Signed coordinate words - fixed.** Every coordinate in the
manual is signed (`X+0 Y+38.5`, `Z-40`, `I+50 J+50`; pp. 66, 131, 267).
X/Y/Z/I/J now always carry `+`/`-`; F, S, T stay unsigned as there.
G words are written two-digit (`G00`..`G03`, the overview p. 752).

(3) **Program begin/end - fixed.** p. 130: first block `%name G71 *`
(G71 = mm "at start of program", p. 755), last `N99999999 %name G71 *`.
The stream has no program name, so the machine's name stands in, cut
to the file-name characters of p. 143 (`VMC 3-AXIS` -> `VMC_3-AXIS`).
The old `(name)` line is gone: parentheses are no TNC comment (p. 172,
comments are `;`). Dropped: a fixed name `CAMCRAFT` (loses the
identity line for nothing).

(4) **Drilling - G81-G89 were wrong, and dangerously so.** p. 752 lists
the drilling cycles as G200-G209 only; p. 756 shows G73 is ROTATION
(`G73 H+45`) and G80 the tilted WORKING PLANE. The old peck
`G73 X.. Y.. Z.. R.. Q..` would therefore have been read as a
coordinate rotation, and the preamble's bare `G80` as a working-plane
reset. Chosen: no cycle word at all - every hole posts its expanded
chain (the generator's own plunges, peck retracts and exits, exactly
what the simulation verified) as G00/G01; a dwell is `FUNCTION DWELL
TIME<s>` (seconds, p. 456) right after the move reaching the bottom
(a dwell whose chain never reaches it is refused, never dropped).
Tapping is refused by name: plain moves cannot reverse the spindle in
step with the feed. Dropped: `G200`/`G205`/`G207` with Q values -
their Q meanings (Q200 set-up clearance, Q201 depth sign, Q202
plunging depth, Q395 depth reference, ...) are defined in the separate
Cycle Programming manual, not in 892909-25 (p. 71 shows only the
block shape), so mapping them would be guessing. Reopen with that
manual if native cycles are wanted (shorter programs, control-side
peck). BORE and BACKBORE are our own feed-in/rapid-out and
feed-in/feed-out definitions (`cl::CycleKind`), so the chain IS their
meaning; nothing is lost.

(5) **Work offset - G54/G55 were wrong.** p. 756: G54 is DATUM SHIFT
with axis values (`G54 X+20 Y+30 Z+10`); G55 is a touch-probe cycle in
the overview (p. 754). Chosen: the first work offset is the control's
active preset (no word); any other is refused by name. Dropped:
cycle G247 preset selection - its Q parameter is in the Cycle manual.

(6) **Tool call - `T.. M6` replaced.** pp. 71, 218: the tool call is
the T block `T5 G17 S4500*` (number, spindle axis, speed; it applies
the tool's length); M6 is "Tool change ... depends on machine"
(p. 392). Now `T<n> G17 [S<rpm>]`, `M3` in its own block; a speed
change alone is a T block of `S` only (p. 201). G40 G90 ride the
section's first positioning block (`G00 G40 G90 Z+250*`, p. 66), the
old standalone `G17 G90 G54 G40 G80` block is gone.

(7) **Homing - `/G53 Z0` removed.** G53 is DATUM SHIFT from datum
tables (p. 753); machine-referenced moves are M91/M92 (p. 393), whose
datum the machine builder sets - an M91 Z0 rapid could go anywhere.
The program ends `M2` and the end block, where the toolpath's last
retract left the tool, as the manual's own programs do. Dropped: a
`/` optional M91 retract (no documented safe position).

(8) **Judged harmless, left:** M8/M9/M5/M2 standalone blocks (p. 392,
`N20 M30*` p. 133); file extension `.nc` (the TNC's ISO programs are
`.I`, p. 143 - the extension is a transfer-time rename and the host
does not read it; worth a follow-up issue); no G30/G31 blank (only
needed for graphics, p. 131); no spindle axis when the stream has no
tool call (the active tool's axis stands, as before).

Golden diffs, reviewed by normalizing the new form back (strip N/`*`,
signs, two-digit G): every contour/face/pocket/slot/trace golden is
motion-identical; only the frame, the T block and the drilling changed
(drill_plate/drill_peck/synth now show the chain and the dwell);
`heidenhain/tap_plate.nc` is deleted (that golden is now a named
refusal in `conformance::REFUSED`). The Heidenhain synth golden posts
the synth stream with G54 and without the tap; the stream now carries
real chains (other dialects' synth goldens byte-identical). Pinned by
`heidenhain_block_form::heidenhain_posts_the_manuals_numbered_signed_block_form`,
`..._drilling_posts_its_chain_with_the_dwell_at_the_bottom`,
`..._refuses_a_dwell_its_chain_never_reaches`,
`..._refuses_tapping_and_a_non_first_work_offset_by_name`, plus the
updated `conformance`, `arc_planes`, `heidenhain_arc_centre`.

## #7 round 8: riding the corner pieces' leads as cuts fixes the island's hops; the spiral's own load near the island still holds it back (2026-11-07)

**Tried, the round-7 proposal**: `LinkLaw::ride_lead` (adaptive/lift_link.rs), the step
after `late` in `lift::schedule`. A late piece whose lead holds stock right up to its
first point starts at the lead's first point instead. Its lead is ridden at the floor
as a cut, the way the spiral rode it, so each lap shaves the west-wall sub-bite slivers.
That start also holds the slivers in the rim, so the cut begins further back, on the
walk's own path onto the previous piece: the previous piece's air lead where it runs on
to it, then the piece itself. The ride steps back 0 / 1 / 2 / 4 / 6 / 9 / 13 / 18 mm on
the exact walk vertices, never resampled, because a re-ridden stretch resampled at
0.25 mm posted segments a hair off the posted ones and the crossing law read them as a
crossing at (6.67, 34.60). The return onto it is `find`, else `high`. The ridden stretch
must read within `bound` on the stock as it stands. To reach the lift, `WORK_MAX` was
raised to 40,000 r locally.

**Readings** (release, `hsm_one` island 60x40 with a 12x12 island, D/120):
- **Baseline:** 9 hops (pieces 197..237 step 4, leads 24.7-24.9 mm), 4 highs, 1 ride.
- **Lead ride:** 2 hops (cap 8), 30 highs, 9 rides, 6 leads ridden as cuts, 620
  microlift returns. The ridden leads read 17-31 deg against the bound of 47.5.
- **The island now plans on HSM, with no ring fallback and the verifier silent.**
  - Out of cut: air 2,912 + lift 6,429 = 9,341 mm, against 8,221 mm in cut, so
    x1.14, inside the x1.5 budget. 61,848 moves, rest 3.5 mm2.
- **Not landed: the island now fails the judge's other laws.**
  - 176 in-cut breaks past 5 deg (worst 80.2).
  - 6 descents into stock for 2 levels.
  - The worst load is 125 deg = 79.4 % D at (43.66, 25.81), and the plan names it ("no
    step held the load somewhere - the least overload was cut").
  - The breaks and the overload sit round the island's NE corner (41-47, 26-34), in the
    spiral's growth, not at the ridden leads (x 5.3-8.4 on the west wall). The spiral
    itself already reads 125.0 there (the lifted plan reads the same 125.0).
  - Before this, `hsm_report_full_resolution` skipped the island because it fell back.
    Landing this would turn that lane red on breaks, load and descents.
  - The 3D stepped-block island level still falls back. `pocket3d_hsm` passes unchanged,
    so its reason was not re-read.
- **Budget:** not recalibrated. The island's growth needs ~31,090 r, and 40,000 was only
  a probe. That should wait until the plan it buys is legal.

**Chosen:** hold the patch (tmp/issue7-r8-lead-ride.patch in the main checkout,
including the 40,000 probe), keep the fallback, land nothing in code. The hop law is
solved by the ride. What blocks the island now is the growth spiral's load and kinks
round the island's corner. **Next:** the growth near an island corner ("no step held the
load"), then the extra descents (the 2 remaining hops plus high descents read as
descents into stock?), then the budget at ~32,000 r with the #13 band test re-timed.
**Dropped:** riding the lead from its own first point (that point holds stock in the
rim, so every return was refused); a resampled ride back (it reads as a crossing).


## #9 round 2: Adaptive runs on the rotary developed wrap - the M11.4 pin is lifted, refused levels are named by radius (2026-11-07)

**Chosen:** this round resumes round 1's WIP. `machining3d::pocket3d_air_split` no
longer rewrites Adaptive to OffsetRings. Each developed level now goes to
`hsm::plan_level`. The HSM planner either plans it, or refuses it as "the developed
level at radius R" and Offset rings cut it. The seam law (`hsm::Seam`) is round 1's:
under Adaptive, a centre component within 2*(r+leave) of a cover end that spans less
than one lap is refused by name. OffsetRings is untouched.

**Why the measuring changed (round 1's 0.0 % D):**
- The ladder's first level stands *on* the stock's own skin. `cut_levels` includes
  top_z = rho_ref.
- With the r6.2 clamp stock, that skin level is the only one the planner plans. The
  levels that cut material (5.7, 5.2) are refused on out-of-cut travel. So "0 % D" was
  true, but it proved nothing.
- Raising the measuring stock above the skin is no fix. The plan at the top level posts
  no entry descent, so the reading becomes a phantom 100 % D at its dive.
- The fixture now clamps an r7 bar, and is measured from its own skin. Levels 6.5, 6.0
  and 5.5 cut real stock and are HSM-planned.
- The reader also applies the bore law that pocket3d_hsm uses: planar moves inside a
  helical descent's circle count as entry engagement. Without it, the 180-deg readings
  were the helix's closing orbit.

**Entry:** Helix (r1). Under Plunge the planner itself named a 76.8 % D overload out of
the tool-size bore. Under Helix it names none.

**Readings** (release, turned bar wall r6 / neck r5, r7 stock, BN D6, leave 0.5,
stepdown 0.5, law 14.6 % D + 35 % = 19.7 %):

| Radius | Planar moves | Proved arcs | Load | Breaks past 5 deg |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 6.500 | 22,528 | 8,694 | 19.5 % D | 0 |
| 6.000 | 22,528 | 8,694 | 19.5 % D | 0 |
| 5.500 | 7,416 | 2,620 | 18.8 % D | 0 |

- 5.000 is refused by name: the planning budget runs out after 86 revolutions, and
  Offset rings cut it.
- The planner's own overload notes: none.
- Every world move is posed radial, and no arc survives the wrap.
- **Load margin is thin:** 19.5 against a 19.7 bound.

**Rings digest:**
- Read on a build of db95014 *without* the patch: Helix (5263, 2919766036457321567),
  Plunge (5194, 6097177489831100083).
- Plunge matches round 1's patched reading, and the pinned Helix digest passes on the
  patched build. The rings are byte-identical.

**Lanes:**
- `rotary_adaptive::adaptive_plans_the_developed_levels_under_the_load_and_kink_laws`
  (~10 min debug) is heavy.
- `the_developed_window_reaches_the_planner_and_names_each_refusal` is a 12 long neck
  window. It still took 190 s in debug, so it is heavy too. Both run in about 110 s in
  release with --ignored.
- Debug keeps `offset_rings_on_the_wrap_are_the_program_they_always_were` and the
  seam-law unit test `machining3d::hsm::tests::the_seam_cuts_an_area_at_a_cover_end_short_of_a_lap`.

**Dropped:**
- An end-to-end seam fixture. A D-flat bar fails the axis fit's sphere guard when it is
  short (20 long). At 40 long it passes the guard, but the wrap's slicer reports "the
  mesh is open" at every level between the flat and the wall: 8, 4 and 16 dangling
  chord ends across three variants (flat through the ends, a closed flat across the
  seam, a closed flat beside it). The wrap development has not met a non-revolved
  feature before. That belongs in its own issue, not under #9. The seam law is pinned at
  unit level instead.
- A slimmer debug window. A 10 long window at a 2 mm stepdown still took 130 s. It also
  made the planner narrow the helix to 0.9 and then name an overload. That is a second
  finding to follow up: a narrowed helix bore under Adaptive.

**Review fixes (PR #57, 2026-11-07):**
- **The kink law now holds on the posted program, not only the developed one.** Under
  Adaptive, `wrap_exit` chords each developed XY arc at an angular cap
  (`ADAPTIVE_TURN_DEG` = 4 deg per chord) as well as the sagitta. Each end chord is split
  at 0.01 mm of arc (`trim_ends`), so a junction the plan held just under 5 deg gains
  next to nothing. The heavy test pulls the world program back into the developed frame
  and reads its breaks with the same reader. Readings on the whole bar:
  - sagitta only: 98,525 world moves, 12,824 in-cut breaks past 5 deg on the planned levels;
  - a 2.5 deg cap with full-step end chords: 138,097 moves, 14 breaks, all at arc
    junctions (5.0 to 5.9 deg);
  - the 4 deg cap with short end chords (chosen): 160,989 moves, 0 breaks.
  A 2.5 deg cap with short end chords also read 0, at 182,531 moves. OffsetRings keeps
  sagitta-only chords: its rings digest did not move.
- **A ring-cut level is now read from the program's shape.** It is a cut level (some
  cutting descent ends on its plane) whose planar moves have no proved arc. Such a level
  must carry the "Offset rings cut the developed level at radius R instead" note, and a
  named level must post no arc. The old check read "ring-cut" from that same note, so it
  was a tautology. Microlift heights (planar, nothing descends onto them) are not levels.
- **A hard planner error on the wrap now costs the level, not the op.** For example "the
  centre area has no room for an entry": rings cut the level, with a named note. The
  planar ladder still propagates the error. No cheap fixture reaches that error: any
  non-degenerate centre area has a dive spot, so no test pins it.
- The arc-proof tally note names "the developed level at radius R" on the wrap. Planar
  levels keep "Z ...".
- The rings digest now hashes coordinates on a 1e-6 lattice, so it is portable across
  libm builds. It was re-pinned at (5263, 11592310142122113043). On the same build the
  old bitwise digest still matched, so the lattice is the only change.

## Branch / PR flow for issues and cuts (user, 2026-11-07)

The user reworked the procedure: start each issue from the latest main on
a branch of its own; finishing an issue pushes the branch (PR), never merges
it; a cut goes PR review -> merge to main -> tag. Decisions taken filling in
the mechanics (AGENTS.md Issue Law and "A cut goes PR review"):

1. **Branch names** `issue/N-<slug>` (and `release/vX.Y.Z`, `docs/<slug>`):
   the issue number leads, so `gh pr list` and `git branch` sort by issue.
2. **A new `in-review` label** replaces `claimed` once the PR is open, and
   the pick query skips it - otherwise a pushed-but-unmerged issue would
   look stale after 4 h and get reclaimed. Dropped: leaving `claimed` on
   (stale-claim rule fires), closing the issue by hand at push (the law
   closes only from a merged keyword).
3. **Changelog rows are written at the cut, on the release branch**, from
   each PR's `Changelog:` line. Dropped: a row per issue branch - every
   open branch would edit the table's top line, so every second PR would
   conflict. The row names the merge commit and the PR.
4. **Merge commits, never squash/rebase** (`gh pr merge --merge`): branch
   commit hashes survive, so the `fix on ...` comments and `Fixes #N`
   commits stay findable. A branch behind main takes `git merge
   origin/main` (no force-push, which the law forbids).
5. **Review = a subagent that did not write the change**, under the
   Autonomous Work Law (the user reviews afterwards, not in the loop). The
   user can review or hold any PR on GitHub at any time; a hold is a PR
   comment the next cut honours.
6. **Docs/process/CI-only PRs merge once reviewed**, without a cut - they
   carry no behaviour and need no tag, and laws must reach main to bind
   agents.
7. **`release.ps1 -NoTag`** commits the bump and builds on the release
   branch (and refuses to on main); the tag is made on the release PR's
   merge commit after `git diff <recorded tip> <merge commit>` shows the
   trees match, so the zip is the tagged tree. Nothing else merges to main
   from the first issue-PR merge to the tag (a reviewer of this PR found
   the plain `release/vX.Y.Z` name is gone once `--delete-branch` runs, and
   a mid-cut docs merge would make the trees differ).
8. **Overlapping issues stack** on the open PR's branch (parent merges
   first, child retargeted to main), since fixes stay unmerged until the
   cut; an issue PR closed unmerged leaves `in-review` with a comment.

## #19: the lathe lift - turning programs on the field eye, about their fitted spindle: four decisions (2026-11-07)

(1) **The plan carries the nose and the fitted axis, re-fitted from the
generator's own facets.** `plan_program` no longer refuses the Turn family:
`stock_sim::lathe::lathe_plan` reads the op's source through
`operation::source_facets` (exactly `material_of`'s read) and fits
`turning::profile::Frame::about` on it - the same frame the kernels wrote the
moves in - so the field's revolved stadium turns about the line the generator
turned about. The sweep gained a stated axis (`LatheAxis`, new
`field_lathe.rs`; `Stock::simulate_lathe_about`; `simulate_lathe` keeps
`LatheAxis::Z`), and a chord's second end is signed against the first's side
(a parting chord past centre is 7 to -1, not 7 to 1). Dropped: assuming world Z
through the origin (a bar placed anywhere else would be cut 3.6 mm off in the
off-origin fixture); carrying the axis in the cached toolpath (a schema change
for a number the facets already determine).

(2) **Nose tools only; blades refuse by name.** Turning inserts and boring bars
(the nose circle) ride the eye; grooving/parting blades, threading inserts and
form gauges refuse with `LATHE_BLADE_REFUSAL` (#21 owes the blade-profile
sweep) - the nose stadium under-claims a kerf, and a picture that calls ghost
material the part is worse than a refusal. A lathe op's plan radius is its nose
(the display cell law `auto_cell` reads the cutting feature, not the IC).

(3) **The column verdict still refuses, by name.** `simulate_document` refuses
any lathe program with `LATHE_VERDICT_REFUSAL` (a Z height field reads a
parting kerf as a plunge); the revolved verdict at generation governs and the
post gate shows "not judged", as before. Rapids touch nothing on the field
(RS-274 G0, every arm's law) - a rapid through steel stays the generation-time
rapid verdict's to refuse.

(4) **Parity is the sign law at every cell centre, on generated programs.**
Readings (`crates/app/tests/lathe_field_sim.rs`, debug, default box stocks,
TEXELS 512k = 0.5 mm cell): facing 438,976 centres (10,680 cut) 0 sign misses;
facing about an off-origin axis (3, -2) the same counts, 0 misses; profile
rough+finish 438,976 (11,992 cut) 0; multi-pass contour 438,976 (9,160 cut) 0;
boring 429,777 (2,904 cut) 0. The sim suite adds a stated-axis case (0 misses
over the bar, NaN move / zero axis refused, a refusal writes nothing). The
law is written in the test, independently of the engine: air iff inside some
feed chord's nose stadium about the fixture's own axis.

**Review fixes (PR #60, 2026-11-07).** (1) The off-origin test now puts
the setup's G54 on the bar's axis (3, -2): the field revolves about the
FITTED axis, and generation (#62, its own branch) guarantees that is the
machine spindle the lathe post turns about - the module laws say so; the
refusal itself is #62's, not done here. (2) A chord whose ends stand in
different planes through the axis sweeps a hyperboloid whose waist the
flat meridian segment misses (less removed shown than cut): it now
refuses by name (`LatheAxis::chord_in_meridian`, out-of-plane offset
`|ra x rb| / max(|ra|,|rb|)` against `MERIDIAN_TOL` = 1e-6 mm), checked
up front so a refusal writes nothing; parting through/past centre passes
(antiparallel or vanishing radial vectors). Considered and dropped:
sweeping the true hyperboloid - the kernels only write meridian chords,
so a skewed one is a bug upstream to surface, not geometry to draw.
(3) A leaned-axis (10 degrees) parity case pins the general window reach
and the leaned split. (4) The laws state the nose circle is the whole
modelled solid (no flank/holder, unlike the mill's shank). (5) A milling
tool on a turning op gets its own refusal text instead of the column
engine's.

## #62: a turning op's fitted axis must be the lathe spindle, or generation refuses it (2026-11-07, Prime Directive)

The turning kernels fit their axis from the part's facets (any position,
lean up to ~89 deg), while the Fanuc lathe post writes X as the diameter
about the work offset's origin and Z as world Z. A part leaning a few
degrees in Y with its X on the origin keeps every move in one meridian
half-plane, so the post's off-meridian check passes and a taper is posted
silently (pinned: before the fix, a 3-degree lean faced and posted with
no script refusal).

1. **Chosen: refuse at generation** (`operation/spindle_law.rs`, called
   from `collect_job`) every turning-family op, and the lathe's axial
   Drill, whose fitted axis is not world Z through the op's work-offset
   origin - the same `posting::wcs_context` origin the post receives, so
   generation and post can never read two different spindles. The
   message names the lean (degrees), the offset (mm, at the part's
   mid-height), the slot, and the fix (align the part's axis with world
   Z, move the work offset onto it).
2. **Tolerance: one law, 0.0005 mm of radius**, measured as the axis
   line's XY distance from the origin at the part's lowest and highest Z
   (so lean and offset share one budget, scaled by the part's height).
   0.0005 mm radius is half the diameter word's last digit (X at 0.001 mm
   of diameter), i.e. a part that passes posts every word within one
   last digit of what a perfectly placed part would; an honest revolve
   fits far below it (measured in the review fixes, below).
   Dropped: a separate angular tolerance (0.01 deg was suggested) - over
   a 100 mm part it allows 17 um of radius drift, 35x the output digit,
   so it would admit a visible taper; a length-scaled single budget is
   the honest form.
3. **Lying axes and non-revolved models pass this door** so the turning
   frame's own refusals (LEAN_MIN "off vertical", axis::fit's "not
   revolved") keep their wording and precedence.
4. **Dropped: transforming the program** into the part's frame (posting
   diameters about the fitted axis). A lathe cannot turn about a leaned
   axis anyway; an off-origin plumb axis is fixed by moving the work
   offset, which the refusal names. Refusal is the smaller, safer change.
5. **Dropped: a post-side meridian check.** The post sees only points:
   a plumb frame's radial direction is +Y, so valid programs already ride
   the YZ meridian, and a leaned axis's points are indistinguishable from
   a plumb profile per move. Detecting it would need a new stream PARAM
   (the fitted axis), which changes every lathe stream/golden for a check
   generation already makes; the existing both-X-and-Y refusal stays as
   the post's defence. Only one lathe post exists (`fanuc-lathe.cps`).
6. **Field sim / verify**: on main neither reads the turning axis (the
   rotary kinds' `fixture::rotary_axis_of` is a different family); with
   generation refusing off-spindle parts, any sim that turns about the
   fitted axis (#19 / PR #60) and the post now describe the same line.
7. **Review fixes (PR #65).**
   - *Post-time door.* The stamp held nothing of the work offset's XY,
     so generating on a plumb bar and THEN moving G54 1 mm in Y left
     the op Ok and the post wrote every diameter 2 mm small. Now both:
     `posting::program_ops` re-reads the law against the live
     `wcs_context` origin for every turning op and the lathe Drill
     (before the freshness check, like the tool gate, since
     "regenerate" alone is not the fix), refusing by name; and
     `current_stamp` digests the selected slot's origin for those kinds
     (only when it is off the world origin, so no existing digest moves),
     so the op also reads Stale. Dropped: stamp-only (the post must not
     trust a cache key for a law it can read directly).
   - *Measure = rigid displacement.* The old law bounded the axis line
     at the part's Z extremes only; a lean `a` also cones every face by
     `R*a` (a 30 mm washer 0.4 mm thick at 2 mrad: 0.4 um axis drift,
     passed; 30 um coned face). Now every part vertex is read about the
     fitted axis (radius, station height) and about world Z through the
     origin (radius, Z); the worst disagreement of either word must be
     within 0.0005 mm. Equivalent to the reviewer's "drift at the
     extremes AND lean x largest radius", but exact per vertex.
   - *Fit noise.* Measured on plumb revolves tessellated like an STL
     export (uneven bearings, a micro-seam sliver, f32 vertices, at the
     origin and at (123.456, -78.9)): the eigen-only direction read a
     24-segment stepped shaft 0.0018 deg off, 1.1 um of radius - a
     FALSE refusal (2.2x the tolerance). Fixed by refining, not by
     loosening: `multiaxis/axis_refine.rs` solves the normal lines'
     Plucker concurrency rows (4x4 Gauss-Newton on two tilts and two
     shifts); the refined line is kept only past a 1e-12 rad floor and
     when the fit's own residual does not grow, so even revolves (every
     golden) keep their bits. Worst measured noise after: 3.3e-6 mm
     (~150x under the tolerance); 1.4e-7 mm at the origin. No real
     lathe STL exists in the repo's fixtures; the synthetic STL-like
     revolve stands in.
   - Wording: "posts every word within one last digit", not "the same
     digits".

## 0.12.0 cut: a test-only PR merged mid-cut (2026-11-07)

PR #69 (linuxguy123, `test(ui): serialize GPU render tests`, +6 lines in
`crates/ui/tests/gpu_render.rs` only) was merged to `main` by the maintainer
between the cut's issue-PR merges and the tag. The law (AGENTS.md "A cut goes
PR review", step 4) says a non-empty `git diff <tip> <merge>` means restart
from step 2. Chosen instead: merge `main` into `release/v0.12.0`, run the
suite the change touches (`gpu_render`) and record the new tip, then tag as
usual. Why: the change is a test file - the zip ships no tests, so its
contents cannot differ, and the full release gate (~50 min) already passed on
every shipped file. Dropped: re-running the whole release gate for six test
lines. The rule stands for any mid-cut change that touches shipped code.

## #79: the rapid law reads radial programs as a solid, not a column (2026-11-07, Prime Directive)

Why it was off: M5.2 F2 stood law (d) down for `Mode::Radial` because the
column (height-field) reading cannot see a horizontal bore - a retract
sliding out along its own kerf reads as lateral travel under solid stock -
and trusted the cross-drill kernel's traverse law instead. That made the
post gate blind for radial programs: #77's station change 5 mm inside raw
stock posted silently.

- **Chosen: a solid reading for Radial (`verify/rapids_radial.rs`).** Each
  rapid's flute body - discs of `r - gouge_tol` square to the pose at the
  tip and every 1 mm back to the flute length, walked under the modal pose
  rule (`midpose::intervals`, 0.5 mm of travel at the far end) - is tested
  against the stock prism (the footprint `Rest::in_stock` already reads,
  under the stock top) minus the kerf the cuts BEFORE the rapid swept (a
  tool-radius cylinder about each cutting move, extended back along the
  pose by the flute length when the move plunges along its own axis).
  Any sample in stock and in no earlier kerf convicts: `RapidInStock { at }`,
  the mill law's own blocking word. Retracts up a just-drilled hole and the
  peck's chip break are acquitted by the kerf - by reading the stock, never
  by the path's description of itself (the M13.7 swarf finding); the
  approach to a mouth on the stock surface is clear by geometry.
- The prism is unbounded below, the same reading the column law takes; a
  turned bar or box about the spindle is a Z prism, so the footprint is the
  solid measured about the spindle wherever the work offset puts it.
- Dropped: a `stock_bottom_z` field on `VerifyContext` (30 constructor
  sites, motion tests included, for a reading the mill law never had);
  sweeping the stack against the stock MESH with `SolidIndex` (the raw
  stock mesh has no holes, so every retract up its own hole crosses the
  mouth's facet - the kerf exemption needs point samples anyway); an
  unconditional axial-retract exemption like the mill's vertical one (an
  inward axial rapid is exactly #77's approach into raw stock).
- Not covered (as in the mill law): shank and holder bands against stock
  along a rapid - the flute body is what the law reads.
- Fixture finding: `drilling_cross`'s 44 mm box stock is REAL #77 - on
  main the kernel's part-measured approach stops at x 20 inside the x 22
  box and the hop slides through it (moves 0, 6; move 7 is under the box's
  Z 0 floor, convicted by the unbounded-below reading). The clean-document
  test now runs on a stock equal to the bar; a new test pins that the 44 mm
  box never posts silently (named RapidInStock, post blocked) and owes
  nothing once #82's planner hops outside the raw stock.

### #79 review fixes (2026-11-07)

An independent review of PR #83 found the law correct but costly and
fail-open at its edges. Taken:

- **Cost.** The kerf list is built once (cut order, each cylinder with
  its box) instead of per rapid; a rapid takes only the earlier kerfs
  whose box meets its swept box (padded by body + radius), newest first;
  a disc whose box misses the stock footprint's box (or stands above the
  top) skips the polygon test; a disc wholly inside one kerf cylinder
  (the retract riding its own hole's axis) is acquitted in one test
  instead of 25; shared interval ends are sampled once. Reading on a
  hand-made 40-hole pecked radial program (debug, `radial_rapids::
  forty_pecked_radial_holes_verify_clean_within_a_wall_time_bound`):
  **~9.5 s before** (1 mm discs) **-> ~0.25 s after** with the discs
  tightened to 0.5 mm (`BODY_STEP` now agrees with the module doc). The
  test holds a 3 s bound. Dropped: a per-point bbox inside
  `Region::contains` in geo2d (shared by every law; the footprint box
  reject in the radial law gets the same win locally).
- **Fail closed, by name.** A non-finite stock top or Z tolerance, or a
  tool with no finite positive radius, convicts every rapid
  (`RapidInStock`, the law's own blocking word); a rapid whose stated or
  held pose is no direction convicts itself instead of reading as
  upright; a cut with such a pose keeps only its tip's kerf (less kerf,
  more convictions). A zero or non-finite flute length reads as a body
  one tool diameter long, never the bare tip. Dropped: a new `Warning`
  kind ("rapids not judged") - it ripples into the UI's warning table
  and the project-file serde for a context generation never builds;
  RapidInStock already blocks and the move index names where.
- **Sampling bound documented.** Discs 0.5 mm apart, tip travel 0.5 mm
  between samples, and the 16 rim samples' chord sag `r (1 - cos(pi/16))`
  ~ 0.019 r: a graze deeper than the gouge tolerance by less than that,
  between two rim samples, can pass.
- **Tests.** Sim: past a drilled hole's bottom (flat end convicts), a
  tangential graze at half the gouge tolerance (clean) and twice it
  (blocks), a diagonal retract half in the hole (blocks), the non-finite
  context, the zero-direction pose, the zero/NaN flute. App: the radial
  tests moved to `drilling_cross_rapids.rs` (fixtures to
  `tests/cross_support/`, drilling_cross back under 400 lines) and a new
  deterministic `a_station_hop_spliced_through_the_bar_is_named_and_the_post_refuses`
  (the clean bar document's path plus one hand-spliced hop through the
  bar, judged by the real verifier, refused by the gate by move index) -
  it speaks whatever #82 does to the planner. The 44 mm box test stays as
  the planner-tracking twin (vacuous after #82, by design).

## #74: GPU adapter selection on hybrid laptops, frame-time budget (2026-11-07)

User report: Intel UHD + Quadro P3200 laptop never renders on the Intel
adapter, the NVIDIA chip does not take over, and the P3200 lags 1-2 s on an
empty scene. Chosen:

- **Adapter order** (`egui_app/gpu_select.rs`, pure, unit-tested on a
  synthetic hybrid list): inside each backend mask of the existing chain
  (preferred -> PRIMARY -> all), enumerate every adapter and log it (name,
  vendor, device, type, backend, presentable or not), then try: the adapter
  the user named -> the GPU wgpu's `PowerPreference::HighPerformance`
  request answers with (any of its backends) -> every other presentable
  adapter, discrete -> integrated -> virtual -> other -> cpu; ties go to the
  platform's native backend (DX12 on Windows, Metal on macOS, Vulkan
  elsewhere), then enumeration order. Adapters that cannot present to the
  window are skipped by name. Each candidate must give a device AND a
  surface configure that passes a validation scope; a failure logs its
  reason and moves to the next adapter, and adapters that failed under an
  earlier mask are not retried. When none works the refusal names every
  adapter tried and why, on stderr and in a native dialog.
- **Native backend before Vulkan for the same GPU**: on Optimus laptops a
  discrete Vulkan device presents through a cross-adapter copy to the
  iGPU-owned display; DXGI (DX12) does that natively. Ranking by backend
  inside the HP pick is the one change in default behaviour on Windows.
- **Surface config from capabilities**: the surface's own first format,
  Fifo (present in every spec-conforming surface) unless absent, Opaque
  alpha when offered else the first reported. Replaces get_default_config +
  a hard-wired AutoVsync.
- **Adapter choice setting**: `--gpu <name substring>` over
  `CAMCRAFT_GPU=<substring>`, the pattern `--gpu-backend` /
  `CAMCRAFT_GPU_BACKEND` already set. Not a world setting through the
  command path: the choice is consumed before the window and the document
  exist, cannot be changed live, and is per machine, not per project.
  Dropped for now: a preferences page entry (no persisted per-machine
  settings store exists yet - it would have to be built first).
- **Stall**: no blocking readback or `device.poll(Wait)` is on the idle
  frame path (the readbacks are test/diagnostic only; the traced-stock eye
  only marches with Deviate/playback armed). Not reproducible headlessly, so
  a frame-time budget (`egui_app/frame_watch.rs`) logs any frame over
  100 ms naming its phases (commands+scene, ui, acquire, encode,
  submit+present), rate-limited to one line per 5 s. The reporter's log
  pins the phase; the DX12-first ordering is the leading suspect fix.
  Dropped: switching the loop from Poll to redraw-on-input (changes
  playback animation behaviour; not proven to be the cause).
- **Review fixes (PR #76)**: (1) each candidate's configure, View3D build
  and a presented test frame (acquire, clear, submit, present, then a
  5 s-bounded `device.poll`) run inside Validation + OutOfMemory + Internal
  error scopes - OOM/Internal would otherwise reach wgpu's panicking
  default handler - and a device-lost callback flags a lost device, which
  wgpu 30 reports only through that callback; any of these fails the
  adapter by name and the next one is tried. Occluded/Timeout/Outdated on
  the test frame are not held against the adapter (window not presentable
  yet). (2) "Same GPU" across backends matches on PCI vendor + device ids
  when both are non-zero (DXGI and Vulkan name GPUs differently), the name
  only otherwise, so the DX12 entry shares the HP rank. (3) The refusal
  lists skipped adapters and empty backend masks, not "no adapter found".
  (4) The View3D pipeline is built per candidate: a failure there drops
  that adapter and tries the next, instead of exiting with no dialog.
  (5) `--gpu=x` / `--gpu-backend=x` parse; a surface-handle failure keeps
  the failures collected so far. Dropped: rendering a full egui frame as
  the test (needs the renderer per candidate; a clear+present exercises
  the same present path).

## #67: the cross drill measures about the work offset's spindle (2026-11-07)

`drilling::cross_drill` measures every standoff (bar radius, a station's
side, the hop/clearance radii, the station-change chord law) about world Z
through world (0, 0); the posts program about world Z through the work
offset's origin. Chosen: carry the job into the spindle's frame in a new
`operation/cross_spindle.rs` - the holes shifted by the `wcs_context` origin
(now collected once into `GenJob::wcs_origin`, the very origin the spindle
law judges), `stock_r` measured about that line, the kernel run unchanged,
the chain shifted back. An origin on world Z skips the shift, so every
on-origin chain keeps its bits. Considered and dropped: teaching the motion
kernel a spindle centre (a kernel API change for a frame shift the app seam
already owns), and re-latticing the shifted chain (it moved the kernel's
unsnapped chord points off the on-origin chain).

- *Spindle law for the mill-turn.* `spindle_law::turns` now also covers a
  Drill with cross holes on a mill-turn (the lathe's Drill was already in),
  so a revolved bar off its work offset is refused by name there too, at
  generation and at the post, and moving G54 stales the op.
- *Unreadable parts.* A plain lathe's cross drill refuses by name a part the
  axis fit cannot read as turned, as its axial drill already does. The
  mill-turn's does NOT: a hex or square bar is ordinary cross-drill stock on
  a C-axis machine, and with the standoffs measured about the posted spindle
  its envelope is honest whatever the part's shape (the drilling_cross suite
  drills exactly such a rectangular bar). Dropped: refusing it everywhere.
- Left open: the standoff radius reads the part's facets, not the setup's
  stock - a cross drill run before the bar is turned to size would hop
  inside the raw stock. Worth its own issue.

## #77: the cross drill stands off the raw stock, not only the part (2026-11-07)

Step-1 finding: on a mill-turn with A/B rotaries declared, an r10 bar in an
r20 raw cylinder generated Ok and POSTED SILENTLY with its start/approach at
r15 and its station-change chord passing r15 from the spindle - 5 mm inside
uncut stock (`G00 X15 Y0 Z10`, `G00 X21.213 Y0 Z10` -> `G00 X0 Y21.213 Z0`).
The verify crate's rapid-in-stock law stands down in `Mode::Radial`, so no
gate saw it (P0). Chosen: `operation/cross_stock.rs` measures the part and
the setup's stock (`GenJob::stock_facets`, the vertex hull: a box's
circumscribed radius, a cylinder's own) about the spindle and stands off
the larger; when the stock reaches past the part, each mouth moves out
along its own axis to the raw surface with the floor kept (the drill feeds
the uncut skin; the Auto cycle reads the true depth); the stock's Z top
feeds the end-face detour. Then every rapid of the chain is proven clear
(kerf retracts excused, the axial approach outside the raw stock, the
detour above the Z top plus the rim, everything else outside the radius
plus the rim) - refused by name otherwise. A stock that does not reach past
the part, or none (the op's source IS the stock, or no stock declared),
keeps the part-only chain bit for bit.

- *Stamp.* A cross drill's stamp now digests the setup stock (placement and
  geometry signature) - re-sizing the bar after generation stales it, so
  the old hops never post. Only that kind writes the term; every other
  stamp keeps its bits.
- *The proof found a kernel gap.* The quarter-turn chord law assumes mouths
  on the station's centre line; mouths off it (an (8, -6) / (-6, 8) pair on
  an r10 bar) chord 10.757 mm from the spindle, the r2 drill's rim 1.24 mm in
  the bar. Today that is refused by name; inflating the hop for offset
  mouths is a follow-up issue, not this fix.
- *Fixtures.* drilling_cross_spindle's world declared a 60x60 box stock
  centred on the world origin; read as raw stock it differs about each
  spindle, so that suite now uses stock-from-the-bar (its law is the
  spindle frame's alone).
- Dropped: bumping `r_d` by the stock/part gap (one number for all holes,
  and the kernel's margin follows `r_d`, pushing every hop out twice), and
  reviving the rapid-in-stock law in `Mode::Radial` (its height field cannot
  see a bore - the doctrine the sim crate states).
- Left open: a lathe cross drill is blocked at the post by "move 1 cuts past
  the finish surface" - `lathe_axial` is true for any lathe Drill, so
  `axial_warnings` judges the radial chain as a meridian cut. Safe-side
  (blocks), but a false refusal; worth its own issue.
- *Bit-identical, scoped.* "Bit for bit" is pinned on the existing
  fixtures; elsewhere the radius now read with `hypot` (where #67's reading
  took `sqrt(dx^2 + dy^2)`) may differ in the last ulp.
- *Stamp churn, once.* The new stock term changes every existing cross
  drill's stamp, so a saved document opens its cross drills Stale once and
  they regenerate - accepted over a versioned stamp (one regenerate, then
  quiet; a stale op never posts, so it is safe-side).
- *Review fixes (PR #82).* (1) An off-centre hole's mouth is now where the
  drill's edge nearest the axis (transverse `max(|t| - d/2, 0)`) meets the
  raw surface, not its centre line, and the proof's along-the-hole branch
  checks the swept drill slab (and, behind the flutes, a wider shank's)
  against the raw radius: r10 part, r20 raw, t 9, d 6, `r_d` 1 had the edge
  at r19.792 (0.2 mm in the bar, posted); now r20.956. (2) The proof uses
  the body rim `max(d, shank_d)/2`; the clearance and hop handed to the
  kernel are raised to `shank_d/2 + 0.1` in `cross_stock::body_clear` when
  the shank is wider than the drill (the kernel's margin is `d/2 + 0.1`), so
  a 3 mm drill on a 6 mm shank swings at z 23.1 over a z20 end face, not
  z 21.6 (shank 1.4 mm in it). Kept out of the kernel; a shank no wider than
  the drill moves nothing. (3) A hole plunging away from the spindle is
  refused by name in `to_raw_mouths`. (4) Found on the way: the proof read
  the opposite-station swing (which runs along the new pose's own axis) as
  an along-the-hole approach and refused every raw-stock opposite pair;
  the end-face check now runs first. Dropped: refusing a wide shank by name
  instead of raising the planes (a valid tool, only more standoff needed).
  Left open: the holder (`holder_d`) over the end face on a diametral swing
  is not in the body rim; the along-the-hole edge check covers raw stock
  only (a part-only off-centre hole's mouth is the user's).

- *Review fixes (PR #78).* (1) Every cross hole must plunge TOWARD the
  spindle line: in the spindle frame, the mouth's radial offset dotted with
  the plunge must not be positive, or `cross_spindle` refuses the hole by
  name in world coordinates. The station law stands a tool on the mouth's
  side at the hop radius, so on a mill-turn block sitting off G54 a hole on
  the face nearer the axis, plunging away from it, parked the tool beyond
  the far face and rapided through the block. Chosen: the per-hole rule (it
  refuses exactly the holes that would collide). Dropped: refusing a
  prismatic part whose box does not straddle the G54 line (coarser - it
  would refuse the block's safe far-face holes too). (2) On the shifted
  path a kernel refusal is carried back to world coordinates (the hole's
  mouth point rewritten), so the user reads the point in their own model.
  (3) A lathe part whose fit returns a degenerate axis says so, rather
  than "its axis lies near the table". (4) A test pins that moving G54
  under a generated mill-turn cross drill stales it and the post refuses.

## #84: drilling refuses a hole deeper than the flute from the stock surface, and proves the holder clear (2026-11-07, Prime Directive)

- *Reach rule.* Every drilling op (cross and axial, every cycle) refuses by
  name a hole whose depth from the STOCK surface exceeds `Tool::flute_len`
  ("hole X is Y mm deep from the stock surface; tool T's flute reaches Z
  mm"). Chosen: the conservative rule - past the flute the shank enters the
  hole, and nothing models a necked shank's wall clearance, so a `shank_d <
  d` tool is held to its flute too. Dropped: relaxing for necked tools;
  measuring from the part surface (the uncut stock is what the shank hits -
  #77 moved cross mouths out to the raw surface, ~16 mm vs ~6 mm deep).
  Verify's law (e) (`flute + shank + holder` from the part entry, a
  warning) stays as the softer, later net.
- *Cross depth* is read off the spindle-frame hole list after
  `to_raw_mouths`: `-floor_d` plus `THROUGH_CLEAR` on a through hole,
  `min(SPOT_DEPTH, -floor_d)` for a spot cycle - the depths the kernel
  feeds. *Axial depth* is read off the kernel's own cycle records: from the
  highest material over the drill's (or a wider shank's) disk down to
  `bottom_z`. The material is the part's facets as they stand, plus the
  setup's stock clipped to the cycle's R plane (the cycle rapids down to R,
  so stock above R is the rapid laws' business, not stock this cycle feeds
  through). Conservative: a facet counts at its highest vertex when its
  projection meets the disk, and a stock declared over a part counts at
  full height to R even where a prior op milled it (drilling has no
  rest-material reading yet) - a possible false refusal on a pocket-floor
  hole with stock, never a silent collision. Dropped: counting the stock
  above R (every faced block whose Top Z sits under the raw top would
  refuse every hole).
- *Holder.* Read from the tool stack as modelled: the holder's face stands
  `flute_len + shank_len` behind the tip, `holder_d` wide, `holder_len`
  long; no holder modelled (`holder_d` or `holder_len` 0 - the turret-held
  kinds) means nothing to sweep. Axial: the face, `flute + shank` above
  the cycle bottom, must stand above the material top over the holder's
  disk. Cross: on every move (rapid and feed), the holder - a horizontal
  cylinder about the move's tool axis - must either ride with its lower
  edge (`z - holder_d/2`) above the stock's Z top, or keep the XY rectangle
  its footprint sweeps (convex hull of the eight corners) outside the
  stock radius `st.r`. The end-face swing between opposite stations is
  REFUSED by name when the holder would sweep the end face, not raised:
  the clearance that clears a Ø44 holder is the user's to set (a test pins
  that raising Clearance by 20 mm then drills), and a kernel that silently
  lifts the swing 22 mm hides a setup choice. Closes the "left open" of
  #77's review (the holder over the end face).
- *Fixtures that now refuse - real reach collisions.* The F2 cross bar
  (`cross_support`): its 30 mm through hole is 31 mm deep from the bar face
  (38 mm from the Ø44 raw box's face; the law reads 47 off the box's corner
  radius - #85) on DR-0400's 12 mm flute - re-ground to a
  50 mm long-series flute. `drilling_cross_stock`: mouths on the r20 raw
  bar 16-24 mm above their floors - flute 30. `blind_floor` and
  `solid_law`'s drill gouge tests drilled 14-15 mm from the z20 stock top -
  flute 30 there (they pin the solid/gouge laws, not reach).
  `operations::moving_the_part_marks_the_drill_op_stale_until_regen`: the
  block moved up 2 mm stands 13 mm over the stored through floor - flute 20.
  `operations::a_hole_deeper_than_the_drill_reaches_warns_and_still_generates`
  (M1.6: a 131 mm hole on the 12 mm flute generated with a ShankHit warning
  for the post gate to refuse) is overturned by this issue's done-criterion
  and becomes `..._is_refused_by_name`. `posting`'s warned-path test used
  that same fixture; its warned path is now a contour whose Ø8 shank over a
  2 mm Ø6 flute rides into the part's wall (the post gate's refusal of a
  warned path is what it pins). Verify's cycle-reach law (e) in practice no longer
  fires on a generated drill path (this law is stricter); it stays
  as the net for paths that reach verify another way.
- *Review fixes (PR #90).* (1) Tap, Bore and BackBore run in a hole that
  is already there (the kernel's solid-cycle door lets them by; the bore
  door already proves the cutting end fits), so they are no longer held to
  the flute: within the flute nothing but the cutting end is in the hole;
  past it the shank must fit the hole's diameter (`shank_d <= 2 r`), refused
  by name otherwise. The holder law still applies. Dropped: holding them to
  the flute (a 25 mm bore on BR-1000's 20 mm flute in a pre-drilled Ø12 hole
  was falsely refused). (2) The cross holder is judged per Z band: each
  move's holder Z extent (both move ends, both holder ends, its radius
  across the axis) against the widest part or stock radius within that band,
  each facet clipped to the band. A holder riding above the end face meets
  no material - the old global `z_max` skip falls out of it - and a Ø60
  flange 30 mm below a hole in a Ø20 section no longer refuses it. Dropped:
  the global stock radius (false refusals on any stepped shaft). (3) An
  off-centre cross hole's reach is the wider body's: a shank wider than the
  drill meets the raw bar further out than the drill's edge (raw r20, offset
  15, Ø3 on Ø6: 1.244 mm), and `to_raw_mouths` now returns that extra
  per hole for the reach law; the mouth itself stays at the drill's edge
  (where cutting starts). (4) A non-finite or negative `holder_d` /
  `holder_len` is refused by name (AddTool already refuses it; this guards
  any other path in); 0 still means no holder. (5) `meets_disk` skips
  facets with no 3D area, and reads a wall (no XY area) by its edges only -
  the same-sign inside test passed every disk on a wall's line. The
  cross_support fixture note now gives the raw box's true face depth, 38 mm
  (47 is the box corner radius, #85).

## #91: a drill's R plane below the unfaced stock top is refused at generation (2026-11-07, Prime Directive)

- *Proven P0 first.* An axial DR-0400 drill on a block (part top Z 20)
  under a box stock whose top stands at Z 25, R plane = Top of Part Z = 20,

  silently through both dialects - Fanuc `G00 X0 Y0 Z20` / `G81 X0 Y0 Z12
  R20 F80` (and `G73 ... R20 Q12` for Peck), Heidenhain's expanded chain
  `G00 X+0 Y+0 Z+20` - a 5 mm rapid through uncut stock. Two holes let it
  by: #84's `top_over` clipped the stock to R ("the rapid laws' business"),
  and law (d) skips every vertical rapid as "a retract through the tool's
  own kerf".
- *Chosen: validate early.* `drill_reach::r_plane_clear` refuses by name,
  per cycle (every kind), a raw stock top above the R plane over the tool's
  body disk (the wider of drill and shank) - "R plane Z .. is below the
  stock top Z .. over the hole at (..) - the rapid down to R would cross
  uncut stock (a collision); raise Top of Part Z (the R plane) to the stock
  top or above". Axial only (the cross drill's mouths already stand off the
  raw stock, #77). With that law first, the reach and holder readings no
  longer clip the stock to R: the depth is unchanged over the body disk,
  and the holder is now held against the true stock top (the clip could
  under-count it by the stock-top-to-R gap).
- *#89 honesty.* The stock is read raw: a facing op earlier in the program
  is not credited, so face-then-drill with R at the faced height is refused
  too. The message therefore does not say "or face the stock first" (the
  check could not see it); it says faced stock still counts at its raw
  height. The refusal stands until #89 credits prior removal; the
  workaround is an R plane at the raw stock top (an air feed of the gap).
- *Verify layer held, filed as #96 (P0).* The net - law (d) judging a
  vertical rapid DOWN by its column (`to.z` below `Rest::surface_before`
  inside the stock is `RapidInStock`) - was written and green in
  camcraft-sim, but it is not contained: it convicts existing app fixtures
  that rapid below their declared stock top in non-drilling ops (posting's
  Contour1, retract 8 in a 10 mm stock; operations' Pocket3D shell test) -
  real collisions by their own stock, so the same bug class reaches every
  op, not only drilling. Fixture-by-fixture triage over all suites is its
  own issue; the patch and its tests ride #96.
- *Fixtures that now refuse, all real by their declared stock:* the lathe
  axial drill (drilling_axial, lathe_post: a 44 mm box at z 0..44 over a bar
  z -20..20, R 20 / clearance 30 inside it) - the box now sits on the bar's
  envelope, z -20..20, the posted golden unchanged; drilling_cross's Z-only
  file test (R 15 / clearance 20 under the Ø44 box's Z 44 top) - R raised
  to 44, clearance 50.
- *Dropped:* clamping R up to the stock top silently (a height the user
  did not set; the kernel never invents clearance).
- *Review fixes (PR #97).* (1) The R-plane law reads the part as well as
  the stock - its facets over the body disk and the hole's own entry
  surface (the modelled hole is what the cycle cuts, not air yet) - so a
  stockless op, or one whose source is the stock, no longer hands the law
  an empty slice: R 15 under a part top Z 20 with no stock is refused,
  naming "the part top". The message names whichever of part and stock
  stands higher. (2) A facet counts at its plane's maximum over the disk,
  not its highest vertex: the triangle is clipped to the octagon that
  circumscribes the body disk and read at the clipped corners (a plane's
  maximum over a convex region is at a corner; the octagon holds the
  disk, so it never under-estimates - at most r(1/cos 22.5deg - 1) of
  slope reach extra). A 1-degree drafted casting now passes R 0.3 mm over
  the local surface and its refusal names the local height, not the far
  vertex 0.4 mm higher. Dropped: sampling the disk boundary (can miss a
  facet corner inside the disk), clipping to the bounding square (41 %
  more slope reach than the octagon). The same reader serves the reach
  and holder laws (tighter there, still conservative). (3) Seeding: the
  drill's Top of Part Z stays seeded from the carried top (Top of Model
  + 0 by default) - not switched to Top of Stock. The seed has no world
  in hand (`retype_params` folds the old kind's numbers only), and Top of
  Stock resolves to nothing without a stock, so the seed would refuse
  every stockless document ("no stock yet") - a behaviour change for the
  no-stock case the review asked to keep. The UX cost, recorded: a stock
  with top allowance refuses a fresh drill's first generate, by name,
  until R is raised (picking "stock top" in the height field is one
  click). Revisit if seeding gains world access (a fallback reference).
  (4) drill_rplane asserts the refusal's words in the post path too and
  pins Spot / Tap / Bore, a hole beside the stock footprint, R from Top
  of Stock, the stockless and drafted cases. (5) drilling_cross's Z-only
  file fixture now asserts it generates Ok, proving the raised R. One
  more fixture was a real refusal by the part: operations'
  moving-the-part staleness test moved the block UP 2 mm under its fixed
  R 10 (the rapid onto R crossed 2 mm of part); it now moves down, the
  staleness pinned unchanged. The material-top readers moved to
  `operation/drill_top.rs` (drill_reach stays under 400 lines).

## #72: Linux release assets

- Build Linux x86_64 on Ubuntu 22.04 so the release binary targets an older
  glibc than the current Fedora workstation. Ship a portable TAR.GZ plus DEB
  and RPM from the same staged binaries and assets. The package installs its
  binaries and `assets/` together under `/usr/lib/camcraft`, matching the
  app's adjacent-theme lookup; short commands in `/usr/bin` launch them.
- Let the existing Windows release job publish after the Linux job succeeds,
  with the Linux outputs downloaded as artifacts. Dropped concurrent release
  publishers: both jobs would race to create or edit the same GitHub Release.
  AUR, FreeBSD, and Web/WASM remain separate slices of #72 because they need
  their own package or platform build paths.
- The macOS build uses one Apple Silicon runner to compile arm64 and x86_64
  binaries, joins each pair with `lipo`, and publishes a universal app in ZIP
  and DMG form. Resources stay in `Contents/Resources` and the theme resolver
  reads them there. The bundle is ad-hoc signed so both slices are valid,
  with notarization left for when a Developer ID and credentials are available.
  Dropped two native macOS runners: that would double the runner setup and
  make a single universal app require a third combining job.
- The Linux release tarball is the shared input for the Snap and Flatpak jobs,
  so packaging either format does not compile Rust again. AppImage uses the
  same release binaries and bundles adjacent assets with linuxdeploy; its
  download is pinned by SHA-256. The Snap uses core22 to match the Ubuntu
  22.04 build host and strict confinement with desktop, GPU, and home access.
  The Flatpak targets the Freedesktop 25.08 runtime and grants Wayland/X11,
  GPU, and project-file access. Both are downloadable release files; store
  publication and runtime validation still require a successful runner build
  and desktop hand test.

## #96: a vertical rapid down into declared stock is a rapid in stock

- **Law.** Verify's rapid law (d) no longer skips every vertical rapid as
  "a retract through the tool's own kerf": a rapid going DOWN whose end
  is below the surface the cuts before it left at its column, inside the
  stock, is `RapidInStock` (the held patch, unchanged). A peck or a later
  level's re-entry down its own earlier plunge stays clean - the cut-order
  chords acquit it; a retract up stays clean. Pinned by
  `crates/sim/tests/vertical_rapids.rs` (4 tests) and
  `crates/app/tests/vertical_rapid_stock.rs` (the contour under a 10 mm
  block is named at generation and refused at the post; over stock to its
  top it posts).
- **One false conviction found, fixed in the app, not the sim.** The
  turned family's Envelope kinds (ProfileRough/Finish, Facing, Chamfer,
  Taper, MultiPass, Boring) put the spindle axis on world Z, so their
  axial rapids are vertical in the column's eye: the column over a point
  beside the bar holds the blank (box or bar) all the way down, whatever
  radius the part or the earlier rungs leave - the column cannot see the
  meridian (the `Mode::Revolve` doctrine, which already stands law (d)
  down for the blade kinds). `operation/turning_rapids.rs` drops the
  column law's verdict on a turned path's axial rapids only, so that
  family reads exactly as before #96 (lateral rapids still judged).
  Considered and dropped: a `VerifyContext` flag (40 constructors across
  the crates for one family's carve-out), and switching those kinds to
  `Mode::Revolve` (it would also stand down their envelope and gouge
  laws). A meridian rapid law for the turned family is follow-up work.
- **No generation-time refusal added.** The common case here was not a
  clearance or retract under the stock top - it was an op whose `top_z`
  (5) sat under a taller block (10), so its plunge-height rapid (top + 2)
  dived into stock with clearance and retract both legal. Verify already
  runs at generation, so the conviction is named on the op the moment it
  generates ("rapid move N travels below the clearance plane inside
  stock") and blocks the post. A named "top of cut below the stock top
  over the op's region" warning would be friendlier but needs the
  op's region and earlier-op removal (#89) to avoid false refusals -
  left for a follow-up.
- **Triage** (every test the law newly failed, full app/ui/motion/sim
  debug suites):

  No golden changed: every .nc / CL golden matches byte for byte.
- **Review fixes (PR #105).** (1) *False refusal of programs that post
  today:* the column read only this op's own cuts and the raw stock top,
  so a face-then-contour (the face takes the block to the contour's top)
  or a pocket-then-drill was refused. Verify now reads the setup's prior
  stock too: `collect_job` collects a `rest::PriorPlan` (the stock grid
  plus the cached moves and tool atoms of every cutting op ahead in the
  same setup - the re-machining `ahead_of` law, program order by name)
  for every untilted, non-turned op; `run_job` cuts it
  (`PriorPlan::simulate`, the costly half) only when verify convicted a
  rapid, and `verify::acquit_by_prior` keeps a vertical dive's conviction
  only while the dive also ends below the prior surface - the same
  verdict as putting the prior in the column's min. Read conservatively:
  the highest grid column under the tool's whole disc; off-grid is air;
  no readable cell, an unbuildable grid or a posed predecessor the grid
  refuses = raw stock (conviction stands, the reason printed). Lateral
  convictions are not re-read. Considered and dropped: a `VerifyContext`
  field (40 constructors), and running `prior_state` for every op at
  collect (a dexel simulation per generation even for clean paths). The
  drill side: #91's R-plane law still reads the raw stock at
  generation, so a pocket-then-drill with R over the pocket floor stays
  refused there (that is #89); verify adds no second refusal (pinned by
  the sim unit test on a pocketed grid). *Owed:* a non-Pocket3D op's
  stamp does not digest the program ahead, so an earlier op regenerated
  shallower after the acquittal leaves the later op Ok on a stale
  verdict (not a regression - before #96 every vertical rapid was
  exempt); the fix is a live re-check at the post gate or the prior
  digest in every stamp (which re-stales every non-first op of every
  saved project) - for the main session to file. (2) pocket3d_hsm: the
  op's `top_z` is raised to 0 (the stock its load reader declares) and
  the verify stock top is back at 0; the ladder is unchanged (levels -5
  and -10, `LEVELS` and every pinned number stand). (3) verify's module
  doc states the vertical-dive law. (4) turning_rapids carries a unit
  test: one axial and one sideways conviction, only the axial dropped.

- The first AppImage crashed before `main`: linuxdeploy rewrote the executable
  and replaced its `.init` instructions with ELF header data. Assemble the
  AppDir directly and use the appimagetool already bundled in the pinned
  linuxdeploy download. The release job extracts the finished AppImage and
  compares its ELF to the built binary byte for byte. The Ubuntu runner has
  no graphics adapter for a headless launch; the desktop run was checked on
  Fedora.

## #71: the lathe axis fit sets off-centre features aside (2026-11-07, Prime Directive)

**Chosen.** `axis::fit` keeps its plain least-squares concurrency fit and
then reweighs it (new `multiaxis/axis_robust.rs`): the facets whose normal
lines meet the candidate axis within the fit's own concurrency tolerance
(`REL_TOL * rho`, 3 % of the mean radius) are the revolved surface; the rest
(keyway walls, cross-hole walls) get weight 0 and the line plus its
direction refinement are refitted on the inliers, up to 4 rounds until the
inlier set stops changing. The refit must pass the full judgement on every
facet (the 90 % concurrency share and coarseness gates), so it only moves an
axis the part already earns. Nothing set aside -> the plain fit returns
untouched (bit-identical; every rotary/turning golden stands). Guard: inliers
under 50 % of the answering area or under 8 facets -> plain fit, marked
untrusted. The guard is a backstop: it rarely fires, because `judge` already
requires a 90 % concurrency share, so a part the plain fit earned seldom loses
half its area to the trim. `axis::fit_report` exposes the plain axis, the set-aside share and
the trust bit; the spindle law names the share and gives the move-the-offset
advice only for a trusted (misplaced) reading - an untrusted one says the
reading is biased by off-centre features and moving the work offset may not
fix it (the share is of the turned, non-end-face surface). A trusted pass
with more than 0.05 % set aside generates with a named, non-blocking path
note (keyways, flats, holes, eccentric sections are not turned - machine them
in a later setup), so an eccentric pin turned as a concentric cylinder is
never silent; a plain revolve carries no note. Measured on a 72-segment D20 shaft with a
10 mm-long keyway: plain fit 0.153 mm (5.18 mm key) / 0.058 mm (10 mm key)
off G54, robust fit 0.000 mm.

**Considered, dropped.** A soft (Huber/Tukey) weight: needs a scale estimate
and never reaches exactly zero residual, so a keyed shaft would still read a
few microns off; the hard trim reaches the exact axis on circumcenter-anchored
facets. RANSAC sampling: nondeterministic and unnecessary when the plain fit
is already within tolerance of the true axis. Loosening `OK_SHARE` so parts
with more than 10 % off-axis area are read: out of scope - a part whose plain
fit misses by more than the concurrency tolerance is still refused as not
revolved (follow-up material if users hit it with long keyways).

## #72: Arch Linux source package

- Add a `camcraft` source recipe under `aur/`, pinned to tag `v0.12.1` and
  the source archive's SHA-256. Arch builds against its own libraries, and the
  tag includes `Cargo.lock`; `prepare()` fetches locked Rust dependencies and
  `build()` runs offline. Keep the binary, CLI, and adjacent assets under
  `/usr/lib/camcraft` with commands in `/usr/bin`, as in the DEB and RPM.
  Dropped `camcraft-bin` for this slice: the current GitHub release has no
  Linux binary asset for every patch tag, while a source tag exists. The AUR
  entry itself will be published after an Arch build validates the recipe.
- Validate `aur/` in a separate manually dispatched workflow on an Arch Linux container:
  compare `makepkg --printsrcinfo` with the checked-in `.SRCINFO`, run
  `makepkg` through its build and test stages, inspect the package contents,
  and upload the result. Keep this out of `release.yml` because the source
  recipe follows tagged versions and AUR updates, while `release.yml`
  assembles assets only for a CamCraft release. Manual dispatch also follows
  the repository policy against running Actions for every PR.
- The first Arch build reached `ld.lld` but could not resolve Flecs C symbols.
  The likely cause is makepkg's default LTO compiling the bundled Flecs C into
  GCC LTO objects that rust-lld cannot consume. Set `options=('!lto')` in the
  package recipe, as the Arch Rust package guidelines prescribe for mixed
  Rust/C projects, and verify the fix with another Arch package build.

## #80: the axial-hole verdict judges axial holes only

- `lathe_axial` (generate.rs) is now true only for a lathe Drill whose cross
  list is empty. A lathe cross drill already ran `Mode::Radial` (the mode
  match tests the cross list first), but the shared verify tail still ran
  `drilling::axial_warnings` on it, and that verdict convicts any chain without
  canned cycles. As a result, every lathe cross drill was blocked ("move 1 cuts
  past the finish surface").
- Laws a lathe cross drill still goes through: the #62 spindle law sits at
  the job and post seam (`spindle_law::turns`) and does not read
  `lathe_axial`. The #67 `cross_spindle::lathe_reads` and the cross kernel
  call, the #77 raw-stock standoffs and `rapids_clear`, and the #84
  `cross_reach` and `cross_holder` all run in the cross arm, which never read
  `lathe_axial`. The #79 radial rapids law runs in verify `Mode::Radial`. The
  #91 R-plane law is axial-only (`axial_reach`), so it does not apply to a
  radial hole. The change removes none of these.
- Mixed lists (Z holes and cross holes in one Drill op) stay refused by name
  at the cross arm's existing door ("not both"). That refusal fires before
  any verdict, so no hole is judged by the other kind's law. Dropped: judging
  each hole by its own kind inside one op. One program would then tell two
  stories about where the tool stands, which M5.2 v1 already refused, and the
  user can split the op in two.

## #85: a cross hole enters the stock where its own line meets it

- Each cross hole's mouth is now where the drill's body, moving in along
  the hole's own line, first meets the raw stock mesh
  (`cross_entry::entry`, spindle frame). It no longer sits where the line
  meets the stock's circumscribed radius. A 60 x 60 box therefore enters at
  its r30 face, not at the r42.43 corner circle. The reach depth (#84) and
  the Auto peck plan are measured from that face. As a result, a 30 mm-deep
  hole from the face of a 44 mm square bar reads 30 mm and posts on a
  35 mm flute (it was refused at 39.1 mm).
- The body is read as a square tube of half-width d/2 about the line, in XY
  and in Z. The tube contains the round drill, so the outermost stock point
  inside it is never nearer the axis than the drill's true first contact:
  the entry errs on the safe side. #77's rule holds because the tube's edge
  nearest the axis is what meets the surface first. The shank's added
  reach (#84) is read the same way at the shank's half-width.
- A round bar is unchanged bit for bit. The mesh reading replaces the
  circumscribed one only when the edge point at the mesh crossing stands
  more than `raw (1 - cos(pi/16))` (about 1.9 % of the radius) inside it.
  A turned bar's facets are chords lying inside the real round bar, and
  trusting them would put the mouth inside the metal. That band covers
  any polygon with 16 or more sides; the stock cylinder has 32. A tube
  that meets no facet also falls back to the circumscribed reading.
  Dropped: always trusting the mesh. That is unsafe on tessellated
  rounds, especially on grazing off-centre lines where the along-line
  error is many times the sagitta.
- The rapid proof (`rapids_clear`) now judges a rapid along a hole's own
  line against that same per-line entry, with the drill at its tip and a
  wider shank one flute length behind it. Before, it was judged against
  the circumscribed radius, which would have refused every box approach.
  Every other rapid (station-change chords, hops, the start/end planes)
  still stands off the circumscribed radius plus the body's rim. The
  kernel's hop and clearance planes are still built on it too, so the
  swing around the bar clears the box corners.
- `cross_holder` is unchanged: it still reads the widest material radius
  in the holder's Z band (circumscribed). This errs on the safe side. With
  mouths now nearer the axis, it could refuse a holder that a per-line
  reading would pass. That is left as a possible false refusal, not a
  collision, and can be filed if a user hits it.
- Review fixes (PR #120):
  - The band was measured against the GLOBAL raw radius, so a round well
    inside it (a stepped bar's d40 section under a d60 step, a cylinder
    stock off the spindle axis, a round boss on a block) was read at its
    chords on grazing lines: the mouth inside metal, the #84 reach short.
    Each facet is now read as its sagitta slab: thickened either side by
    `(h/2) tan(theta/2)`, `theta` the dihedral angle to an edge
    neighbour (|cos|, so a flipped winding hides nothing) and `h` the
    facet's width across that edge - twice the inscribed polygon's
    `(h/2) tan(theta/4)`, an upper bound however narrow the neighbour.
    Dihedrals above 45 degrees are real edges (box 90, hex 60): those
    facets stay exact, so box faces and hex flats read exactly. A round
    bar stays bit for bit: the slab only raises the crossing, which only
    deepens the fall-back to the circumscribed reading (the fingerprint
    test, re-run on the pre-#85 parent 2037891, passes with the same
    values).
    Dropped: trusting a facet only when its normal is parallel to the
    line (a tessellated round has such facets too); falling back to the
    corner circle (the pre-#85 air on every stepped bar).
    Accepted conservatism: an octagon reads as a coarse round, and a flat
    face bordering a tessellated fillet takes that crease's allowance
    (air, capped by the circumscribed reading, never metal). A round
    whose facets share no vertices gets no allowance - a known gap for
    non-conforming STLs.
  - The per-line entry reads the part's facets beside the stock's: a
    part poking out of a box face (a modelling error) still bounds the
    mouth and the along-line rapids.
  - The shank branch of the along-line proof cannot refuse a chain the
    #84 reach law passed (depth to the shank's meeting point <= flute
    means the shank stands outside it at the feed entry); its test pins
    the passing side on box stock.

## #89 - drilling reads what the setup's earlier operations removed (2026-11-07)

- **Chosen:** the axial drill's reach (#84), R-plane (#91) and holder
  laws read the stock top over each disk as min(raw stock, prior
  surface), the prior being #96's `rest::PriorPlan` - the setup's stock
  grid cut by every earlier op's cached moves - read conservatively at
  the highest covered cell (`verify::prior_surface`, now public); an
  unknown cell, an ungenerated predecessor or a posed (tilted) one that
  the column engine refuses all leave the raw stock. The hole's own
  mouth is lowered by the same reading (a counterbore cut first is air).
  The plan is simulated lazily (`operation::drill_prior::PriorCell`):
  only when the raw reading refuses, and at most once per job - verify's
  #96 acquittal shares the same cell.
- **Lathe:** a lathe axial drill reads the grid revolved about the axis
  (the lowest of four compass cells per ring, the highest ring) - the
  spindle carries any cut all the way round. A turning predecessor is
  now cut in the prior plan as its nose ball (moves carry the nose
  centre), not as a flat disc of the insert size, so a facing pass reads
  the faced end, never below it (a few microns high on the grid).
  `prior_state` (the Pocket3D rest mask) keeps its old atom - #109 scope.
- **Cross drills keep the raw stock:** the column grid stands along Z
  and cannot be read along a radial hole line; their laws say nothing
  new.
- **Staleness:** the Drill stamp carries `rest::prior_digest` (as
  Pocket3D's does) and `stale_reason` names the predecessor, so a drill
  judged against an earlier pocket goes Stale when that pocket's
  recorded path moves. Only Drill joins (#109 owns the general case).
  Cost: a drill behind any cutting op now regenerates after it - the
  posting suite's stale test regenerates in program order.
- **Dropped:** reading the prior always (pays a simulation on every
  clean job); reading the lathe grid unrevolved (a facing pass at Y 0
  never covers the drill's disk); a tolerance on the prior reading to
  pass R exactly at a ball-faced end (the reading may never be low).
- **Found:** the lathe Facing kind faces the work MODEL, not stock
  above it ("nothing to face" when the part top is the finished end),
  so a bar's facing allowance in the stock cannot be faced off yet -
  the lathe test models the allowance on the bar.
- **Review fixes (PR #123):** (B1/B2) on a lathe the prior plan credits
  ONLY the Facing kind cut with its nose ball - a boring bar, groove or
  parting blade was cut as a full-diameter disc on the y = 0 strip and
  revolved round the bar, and the column grid credits a turning move
  under standing material (a kerf to the axis) with everything above it
  (the same reason `LATHE_COLUMN_REFUSAL` refuses the column arm); any
  other kind ahead makes the prior unknown, so the raw stock stands.
  Dropped: a meridian (revolved field) prior - the right model, but the
  drill laws read a height; that is #109-sized. A twist-drill
  predecessor is now cut with its point cone (`cone` for Drill as for
  Taper), so a pilot's 118 deg point is not read as a flat floor; the
  nose radius joins the digest; every Drill (not only cross drills)
  stamps the stock it read; `cut_by` keeps a NaN raw height NaN; the
  prior reading pads its disk by half a cell diagonal, refuses (not
  clamps) a ring count past 1e5, and drops vertical-plane arcs from the
  nose-lowered path (lowering only the ends would bend them) - dropping a
  cut credits less, never more.

## #107 - unsaved changes: a dirty flag and a save prompt on exit (2026-11-07)

- **Chosen:** the document is dirty when the command history's undo
  depth differs from the depth recorded at the last save or load
  (`History::is_dirty` / `History::mark_clean` in `camcraft_app::commands`).
  Undo back to the saved point is clean again; a redo past it is dirty
  again; a fresh command while the saved state sits on the redo stack
  makes the saved point unreachable (`None`), so the same depth on a new
  branch stays dirty. `History::clear` (New, Open) starts clean. Ephemeral
  state (selection via `execute_ephemeral`, camera, hover, layout) never
  touches the history, so it never dirties.
- **Why on `History`, not `project::is_dirty(world)`:** the history lives
  in the UI's `State`, not in the world, and the flag is a property of the
  history position; putting it next to `undo`/`redo` keeps it exact by
  construction and still in the app layer. Cost to move: a thin
  `project::is_dirty(&History)` wrapper if a non-UI caller wants one.
- **UI:** the window title leads with `*` while dirty. New, Open (the
  dialog arm) and Quit over a dirty document are held in
  `State::unsaved_prompt` and an egui `Modal` asks Save / Don't Save /
  Cancel (Escape or the backdrop = Cancel); the answer is a queued
  `CommandKind::ResolveUnsaved`. Save without a path asks for one; a
  cancelled or failed save keeps the document and the app open. The
  window X now queues a Quit like Ctrl+Q (a shell whose GPU failed still
  closes at once, since it never drains the queue).
- **The shell is winit, not eframe:** the brief's
  `viewport().close_requested()` + `CancelClose` does not apply - the
  shell owns `WindowEvent::CloseRequested`, so it simply does not exit
  there.
- **Dropped:** guarding the headless `OpenProjectFile` / `SaveProjectFile`
  arms (scripts and tests drive them; a prompt there would hang a
  headless run); a dirty counter bumped per command (cannot know when an
  undo returns to the saved state); hashing the document (costly, and
  derived caches such as toolpaths would make it noisy).
## #103: a turned path's axial rapids judged in the meridian plane (partial)

- **Law.** `operation/turning_rapids.rs` no longer drops the column law's
  word on a turned op's axial rapids and stops there: it drops it and
  judges each axial rapid (no XY travel) in the meridian plane. The
  rapid's nose disc (nose radius less the gouge tolerance) must not meet
  material between its two stations: the part and the setup stock
  revolved about the fitted axis (silhouette envelope per station; a
  station-span x max-radius box where no silhouette reads), less this
  path's own earlier feeds' nose sweep (signed radius, mirrored, so a
  facing pass across the axis counts) and less the stock the program
  ahead faced (the #89 prior grid read revolved, asked only on a
  conviction; job.rs now collects the prior for the turned family too).
- **Chosen:** the declared stock revolved, not the part as stock. The
  turning kernels ignore the stock (rho_clear is the part's r_max + tol),
  so a bar wider than the part is a real crash on the first approach.
- **Found (held):** the lathe_post fixtures (and very likely the
  turning_bore / turning_contour ones) set a 40 mm box stock from Z 0 to
  40 round a 12 mm bar: their approaches at r 6.85 from Z 25 run inside
  that box, so they are convicted - real by the declared stock, which the
  kernels never cut. Owed: decide fixtures (stock the bar's size) vs a
  kernel that roughs from the stock; the groove/part (Mode::Revolve)
  kinds are inside the law's scope too and convict the same way.
- **Dropped:** a sim-side Revolve rapid law (the sim has no stock solid
  of revolution; the app has the frame and the prior); reading the stock
  bore (a tube stock reads solid - conservative, owed).

### #103 resumed: fixtures, not the law

- **Fixtures.** The lathe suites' 40 mm box stock (Z 0 up) round 12-20
  mm bars is replaced by bar-sized stock - a Cylinder of the bar's
  diameter over its Z span - in lathe_post (profile, groove/part; a
  `bar_world` helper), turning_contour (r 10 blank; the stepped r 6 bar
  gets its own r 6 world, `contour_world_in`), turning_blade,
  turning_form, turning_thread and turning_bore. The convictions were
  real against the declared box: the turning kernels never cut stock
  beyond the part, filed as #130. No NC golden changed.
- **One wiring fix, found by turning_form:** the nose disc is the
  tool's `nose_radius` only for Turning and Bore inserts (their moves
  carry the nose centre); a groove/thread blade or form gauge carries
  its tip with the body outward, so it is judged as the tip point (a
  form's `nose_radius` is its crown arc - read as a 6 mm ball it
  convicted every clean form traverse). Owed: a blade's band along the
  axis past the rapid's ends is not read.
- **Held: turning_bore (3 tests).** The boring ride's approach runs down
  the axis (r 0, Z 60 -> -10) into the bar. Against the declared solid
  bar that is a real crash (no pilot hole); against honest stock (a tube,
  or a drill ahead) the law still convicts it, because both readings
  fill the bore: the stock and the part are each read as their OUTER
  silhouette, and the lathe prior credits facing only. A boring op can
  therefore never post - a false refusal class the law must lose before
  #103 closes: read each body's meridian section (inner and outer
  radius per station), and credit an axial drill ahead.

### #103 closed out: the bore reads as air, a pilot drill ahead is credited

- **Annulus, not disc.** `operation/turning_outline.rs` reads the part
  and the stock per station as material between r_in and r_out: r_out
  from the turned silhouette (span fallback), r_in by ray parity from
  the axis point (Moller-Trumbore, four skewed directions, read a hair
  either side of the station so an end face's own plane never counts
  edge-on): an odd count in any direction is a core to the axis (r_in
  0), else r_in is the nearest wall (no wall: nothing there). A bored
  part's hole and a tube's bore are air; a Cylinder with no bore is
  solid to the axis. Cached per station; read only inside the outer
  skin and only after the cheap credits miss. Owed: cost on very large
  meshes (a facet scan per station read, span-filtered).
- **Pilot credit.** An axial Drill ahead in the setup (`rest::drills_ahead`,
  on a lathe too; drill_prior's facing-only prior unchanged) is a removed
  cylinder of the drill radius over its plunge's stations, its point a
  cone of the tool's tip angle (#89's drill atom). Off-axis holes credit
  nothing. Like the facing prior, the turned op's stamp does not digest
  the drill ahead (#109 scope).
- **turning_bore fixture:** the bored bar now has its pilot - an axial
  r 2 drill (AX0, a 70 mm flute DR-0400; names sort ahead of the bore
  ops, which is program order) from the top to Z -12, under the ride's
  -10 window. Chosen over a tube stock: the fixture models a finished
  bore in solid bar, and a pilot is how a bore pass starts. Pinned:
  `a_boring_approach_into_a_solid_bar_with_no_pilot_is_convicted_and_blocks_the_post`.

### #103 review (PR #135): the body, the band, arcs, the point

- **B1, the bar's body.** A Bore tool is judged by its nose disc (the
  cutting tip) AND its body: a disc of max(diameter, shank) / 2 about
  the nose in the meridian, carried up the axis by flute + shank length.
  A pilot credits only the body points inside its cylinder and cone, so
  a Ø10 bar down a Ø4 pilot is convicted (`a_ten_mm_bar_down_a_four_mm_pilot_is_convicted`).
  The turning_bore pilot is now Ø11 to Z -16 (its 118-degree point clear
  under the ride's -10 window). *Assumption:* the body is centred on the
  nose. A bar whose tip sits at its body's edge reaches a full diameter
  off the axis; the catalog does not say which, and the kernel puts the
  nose on the axis for the approach - if that geometry is wanted, the
  body offset joins the tool data (follow-up, not guessed here).
- **B2, the blade's band.** Groove / part / form tools sample ±width/2
  along the axis about the move (the band's centre); a thread samples
  its crest half-width. Pinned by the reviewer's scenario
  (`a_single_groove_at_the_bars_end_is_judged_across_its_band`: one 5 mm
  groove at the end of a bar running 2 mm past the part - convicted; the
  centre point alone is not).
- **S1:** arc feeds credit nothing (a threading half-turn's chord crosses
  the axis). Conservative; an arc's true sweep is owed if it ever
  false-convicts.
- **S3:** a drill with no stated point is read as 118 degrees, not flat
  (a flat point credits MORE); the DrillAhead doc says so.
- **S2** (a pilot deleted after the bore leaves it Ok) is #109's - a
  lathe pin was added there, not fixed here.

### #109: a verdict that reads earlier ops digests them

- **Chosen: the stamp, not a live re-check at the post.** Every op whose
  verdict reads the program ahead now writes the existing rest digest
  (`rest::prior_digest`, the same term Pocket3D and Drill already wrote)
  into its generation stamp, so editing, regenerating, deleting or
  reordering an earlier op of its setup marks it Stale, and the post
  gate - which already refuses Stale - refuses it. Which ops: Pocket3D,
  Drill and every op with no 3+2 frame (`drill_prior::reads_prior`) -
  exactly the set `job::collect_job` hands `verify_prior` (the prior
  acquittal) and the turned family's pilot/facing credits ride. The
  stale reason names the moved predecessor, the same story as Pocket3D's.
- **Dropped: re-running `acquit_by_prior` / `judge_axial_rapids` live at
  the post.** It would keep stamps unchurned, but the post would cut the
  prior grid (the costly half) for every op every post, and two
  readings of one verdict could disagree; the stamp is the one source.
- **Cost, accepted:** every non-first op of a saved project reads Stale
  once on load and clears on regenerate (release notes say so). A posed
  (3+2) op reads no prior and keeps its stamp bit-for-bit. The digest
  reads predecessors' cached paths, so an edited-but-not-regenerated
  predecessor is its own Stale (the post refuses it first), and the
  dependent goes Stale when it is regenerated.
- **RegenerateAll converges in one click (#145).** The digest made a
  frozen batch leave a dependent Stale behind a predecessor regenerated
  in the same batch (a second click). Chosen: rounds inside the
  constructor - stage every Stale op in program order, finish in
  parallel, write the round so the next reads it, stop when nothing is
  Stale (cap: the op count; an op still Stale is named in `skipped`),
  then invert every write so `apply` replays the batch as ONE undo unit.
  Dropped: staging strictly one op at a time (loses M5.3 B's parallel
  finish for independent ops) and leaving two clicks (a user hits it).
  The constructor now writes the world transiently and restores it;
  every caller builds and executes on the main thread.
- **#153 review B1: the path signature is stored at the write.**
  `schema::Toolpath` carries a private `sig` (`path_sig::of`, the old
  `rest::path_hash`) computed in `Toolpath::new`, its only constructor,
  so `prior_digest` reads one word per op ahead and clones nothing -
  O(M) cheap reads per `status_of`, not M full path clones. Chosen
  over a sibling component (every writer would have to keep two
  components in step) and a flecs on-set observer (none exist in app;
  hooks writing components mid-set were not worth the risk). Caches
  are rebuilt whole, never edited in place (the one test that spliced
  a move now rebuilds). N3: the kind tag joins the digest.
  N1: a round defers an op that reads the program ahead when an op
  ahead of it in its setup is staged in that round - each op generates
  once; setups still run side by side.
- Pins: `a_face_regenerated_shallower_marks_the_acquitted_contour_stale`,
  `one_regenerate_all_brings_a_dependent_pair_current`,
  `the_program_ahead_digest_moves_only_with_the_path`,
  `a_reorder_marks_the_dependent_stale`,
  `a_posed_op_keeps_its_stamp_when_the_program_ahead_moves`
  (vertical_rapid_stock), `a_pilot_deleted_or_made_shallower_after_the_bore_marks_it_stale`
  (turning_bore). turning_bore's fixture moved to `tests/common/bore.rs`
  to keep the suite under the 400-line law.

### #103 re-review B3: the bar's body lies toward the axis

- **Law.** The Bore body is no longer centred on the nose: the insert
  sits at the body's edge and the body lies toward the axis, signed
  radius [rho - d, rho] (d the body diameter, max of diameter and shank).
  A bar with its nose on the axis reaches a whole diameter off it.
  Supersedes the "centred" assumption above - the kernel's own ride (a
  Ø10 bar riding r 5.6 in a Ø12 wall) rules it out, as the reviewer
  showed.
- **Kernel** (`motion::turning::bore`). `BoreParams.bar_radius` (half the
  body diameter; 0 keeps the old on-axis rapids) puts the approach and
  the retract at nose r = bar_radius - nose/2 on the cutting side,
  clipped to the ride's own end radii: the bar spans
  [r - 2 bar_radius, r + nose], centred on the spindle, so a pilot just
  over the bar's size admits it. Chosen over r = bar_radius (the nose
  then pokes nose-radius past the body, into a Ø11 pilot with a 0.8
  nose) and over a full disc of radius d about the nose (convicts every
  honest bore). The off-wall retract is now radial to that line, not to
  the axis.
- **Fixture.** turning_bore keeps the Ø11 pilot to Z -16 (Ø10 body plus
  clearance, under the Ø12 finished bore; a 0.8 regrind still fits:
  ±5.4 inside 5.5). Pinned: `a_ten_mm_bar_with_its_nose_on_the_axis_in_an_eleven_mm_pilot_is_convicted`
  (law, nose on the axis convicted, the kernel's centred line clean) and
  motion's `a_stated_bar_enters_and_leaves_with_its_own_axis_on_the_spindle`.
  No golden carries a bore path; none changed.
- The law's unit pins moved to `operation/turning_rapids_tests.rs`
  (size budget).

### #103 re-review B4: head and shank modelled apart

- **Law and kernel share one shape**, `motion::turning::bar_spans`: the
  insert sits at the head's edge, so the head spans [-head_d, 0]
  outward of the nose, over `flute_len` up the axis. The shank is read
  both ways a tool record can mean it, with its edge on the insert's or
  its axis on the head's, and the union kept:
  [-max(shank_d, (head_d + shank_d)/2), max(0, (shank_d - head_d)/2)],
  over `shank_len` above the flute. A shank wider than the head reaches
  past the nose. `centred_nose` puts the kernel's rapids where the whole
  bar (head, shank and the nose past the head's edge) is centred on the
  spindle. `BoreParams.bar_radius` became `head_d` / `shank_d`.
- **Chosen:** modelling over refusing (a stepped-shank bar is an ordinary
  tool, per the coordinator), and the union over the coaxial reading
  alone. The union is conservative: the reviewer's Ø8/Ø12 bar centred
  spans 14 mm, so it is refused in a Ø13 pilot even though the coaxial
  reading (12 mm) would fit. The tool record does not say which reading
  holds. If that false refusal bites, an explicit shank-offset field
  joins the tool data.
- **Pins:** `a_bar_whose_shank_outgrows_its_head_is_judged_by_its_shank`
  (law: the reviewer's scenario convicted centred and on the old line,
  clean in a pilot it fits), `a_bar_whose_shank_outgrows_its_head_is_judged_by_its_full_shank`
  (app: fails when generate passes half the diameters, checked by
  reverting the line), and `a_twelve_mm_bar_in_the_eleven_mm_pilot_is_convicted`.
- **Filed:** #146, the bar's body during cutting feeds (P1).

## #117 - the cross drill is judged against the finished part (2026-11-07, Prime Directive)

- **Chosen:** the cross arm refuses by name (a `GenError`, so nothing
  posts) when the drill - its radius along the hole axis from the
  station to the tip, the point cone, shank and holder - enters the
  finished part's solid past `GOUGE_TOL` (the axial verdict's 0.01 mm).
  The judge is the verify crate's solid law (`solid_hits`, posed along
  each move's tool axis, `hole_walls` on), run on the finished world-
  frame chain in `cross_spindle::cross_drill` (`cross_part.rs`). A
  bisection of the offending plunge says how deep the tip got: less
  than one drill radius reads "the model has no hole there", deeper
  reads "runs past the modelled hole's floor".
- **Dropped:** a `Warning::Gouge` in the verify tail like
  `axial_warnings` (it names a move, not the hole, and every other
  radial law - reach, holder, rapids - already refuses by name in the
  arm); re-reading the holes by recognition (the radial recogniser
  reads YZ/XZ walls only; the swept solid judges any hole, any face).
- **Fixtures were wrong, not the law:** every cross suite drilled a
  solid bar with no modelled hole (22 tests convicted). They now model
  their holes (`tests/punched_bar`: a round bar with radial blind holes
  cut in, and a flat face with one hole). Three choices ride it:
  1. **Off the knife-edge:** the old r10 x 40 bar (L/D 2) sat exactly on
     the lathe axis reader's isotropy door (ISO = 0.5: caps' normal
     moment = half the face's), so any modelled hole was refused as
     "every axis fits" - filed as #152, the reader untouched here. The
     drilled bar runs z -80..20 (L/D 5; the top, z20, every Top-of-Part
     and end-face number rides, is unchanged), which also keeps the
     holes a small share of the surface the fit must find revolved.
  2. **Half-turn images:** one-sided holes tilt the robust axis fit by
     ~0.001 mm, past the spindle law's 0.0005 (the #116 band), so each
     modelled hole carries its image about Z (modelled, never drilled);
     two that meet on one line become one through hole.
  3. **Where the r10 bar cannot carry the hole** (an off-centre hole
     whose edge runs past the bar, y 7..11 or 6..12 - a notch, not a
     hole), the part is a small core the hole never reaches; the raw
     stock, wider, sets every standoff, so the chain is the same (the
     bit-for-bit fingerprints still hold). And the box suite's lump on
     the hole's line (a part poking out of the stock face) is split into
     four lumps in the CORNERS of the drill's square entry band: the
     entry still reads them, the round drill clears them - a lump in the
     drill's own path is now (rightly) a refused gouge.

## #106 - rapid-in-stock reads the tool's footprint, not its centre (2026-11-07)

- **Chosen:** law (d)'s column reading (the lateral rapid's a / mid / b
  samples and #96's vertical dive) asks `in_stock && below
  surface_before` at every sample of the tool's footprint disc of
  radius `r - gouge_tol` - the centre, 8 points at half radius, 16 on
  the rim - not at the centre alone. Any sample in stock and under the
  surface the earlier cuts left convicts. The disc and the sample count
  are the ones `rapids_radial` (#79) and `hidden_along` already use, so
  the mill laws read one tool.
- **Why `r - gouge_tol`:** a dive or link tangent to the stock wall (an
  approach at exactly r off the outline, a link riding its own kerf's
  edge) is not a collision; the full radius would convict it on
  rounding.
- **Left alone:** `acquit_by_prior` already reads the whole disc
  (radius r, the highest prior column under it), so it needed no
  change; the radial (`Mode::Radial`) reading already samples the flute
  body discs.
- **Dropped:** an exact disc-versus-polygon / disc-versus-kerf-union
  test (the kerf union is not built anywhere; sampling with the stated
  rim bound `r (1 - cos(pi/16))` matches the radial law's promise);
  sampling only the vertical law (the issue names both, and the lateral
  law had the same gap).
- **Review fix (PR #138, tip shape):** each footprint sample is judged
  at `z_tip + lift(rho)`, the height the tool's own tip stands at that
  radius - 0 for a square end or inside a bull's flat, the corner arc
  outside it (a ball is a bull with no flat), `rho / tan(half angle)`
  up a drill/taper point - against `surface_before`, which already
  caps at the stock top. The lift comes from the judged `Cutter`
  (`corner_r`, `tip_angle`; `Cutter::lift_at`), NOT
  `ToolGeom::nose_radius` as the review suggested: that field is the
  turning insert's nose and is 0.0 for every mill kind, so a ball mill
  would have read as square. A context with no stated tip is judged
  square, which can only over-report. Left as is: `surface_before`
  still treats every earlier cut as flat to radius r (the column
  model's own optimism near a ball pass's edge, review item 4), and
  the overhang backstop `hidden_along` still reads a flat disc - both
  are pre-existing and model-only.
- **Re-review fix (PR #138, radial gap):** three sample radii (centre,
  half, rim) let a wall that fell between the half ring and the rim be
  judged only by rim samples lifted almost a full corner - a real dive
  into the wall read clean (the earlier bull "clean" pin asserted a
  gouge). Now 8 rings at `d k / 8` with `2 k` points each (the rim's
  16 scaled by radius; 73 samples a station), and ring k is judged at
  ring k - 1's lift, the lowest the tool stands over the band between
  them. Dropped: an exact disc-versus-polygon minimum of the lifted
  surface (needs a lifted-tool / stock-edge distance per wall segment;
  the ring bound d / 8 plus the chord bulge is stated instead).

### #103 after merging #106 (rapid footprint): the facing approach and the lathe's radial rapids

- **Verdict on facing.nc's new 1/5/9/13/17 (inward `G00 X14.6 -> X11.6`
  at each face depth): REAL.** The fixture's declared stock was a 40 mm
  box from Z 0 to 40, never faced (the Facing kind faces the model,
  #130). A rapid at Z 16.8..14.8 runs inside it, and below the previous
  pass's floor the nose ball meets uncut material between r 5 and 6 of
  any bar wider than the neck. The kernel rapided from rho_clear to the
  model's reach at the cut depth. The model is air there; the stock is
  not. **Fixed in the kernel** (`motion::turning::face`): that move is
  now a feed. Rapids stay outside the work; the approach feeds in. The
  fixture also moves to bar-sized stock (`bar_world`, like the other
  lathe goldens).
- **Main's 11/15/19 (outward `G00 X0 -> X14.6` after each pass): FALSE.**
  The column's footprint law (#106) reads the turning insert as a
  vertical-axis disc of the tool's radius about the nose. A lathe pass's
  radial retract back along the plane it just cut is in its own kerf in
  the meridian. The same misreading convicted turning_bore's off-wall
  rapid and turning_contour's chamfer retract after the merge. **Rule:**
  for the turned family the meridian law judges every axial rapid, and
  RE-READS any in-plane radial rapid the column convicted. It may
  acquit; it adds no conviction on radial rapids the column did not
  make. Generalising it to judge every radial rapid was tried and
  dropped: it convicts a finish pass's retract across the rough's
  uncut-by-credit band, because the lathe prior credits facing only
  (review N5, #130).
- **Blade kerf:** a groove or part feed's own kerf is credited across
  its band, not at its centre point.
- **turning_bore pilot is now Ø11.2.** The meridian re-read of the
  off-wall rapid found the bar's head 20 mm above the nose standing at
  r 5.54 in the r 5.5..6 band the ride never cut (above the window
  top). It is a real 0.04 mm overlap, already there during the ride's
  feed (#146).
- **Golden:** facing.nc. The only diff is the five inward moves going
  G00 to G01 F0.05, and main's three false warnings removed. No other
  golden changed.

### #159: the meridian law owns every turning rapid

- **Rule.** For the turned family the column/footprint law (#106) no
  longer judges any rapid in the turning plane, axial or radial. The
  meridian law judges them all and its word stands. Supersedes the
  "re-read only" rule above; a rapid off the turning plane (no current
  kernel makes one) keeps the column's word. The footprint disc of the
  tool's radius about the nose is a mill's reading: it convicted main's
  turning_bore off-wall rapid (move 18), the chamfer's retract (55) and
  facing's own-kerf retracts (11/15/19), all FALSE in the meridian.
- **What the meridian now credits, so it judges radial rapids honestly:**
  - the turning ops ahead in the setup (`rest::turned_ahead`, each at its
    nose; blades at their centre line);
  - a thread's helix arc as constant radius over its stations (the S1
    chord is still never credited);
  - a groove blade's band, and a thread's V, outward of its tip along
    this path's own feeds;
  - a thread's band sampled as its V, not a flat edge at the tip.
- **Real convictions it found, kept:**
  - *TaperTurning on the Ø20 bar*: the ride ends at r 8.8 on Z 40, its
    nose clears r <= 9.6, the bar stands to r 10, and the radial retract
    to r 10.85 drives through that ring. Pinned in
    `a_taper_rides_the_modeled_cone_and_a_square_bar_refuses` (TP0,
    convicted by name). The clean rides now stand on a blank turned to
    the cone (stock from model, `taper_blank_world`).
  - *profile_rough_finish golden*: program order reads names, so P1 (the
    finish) posts ahead of R1 and rides the raw Ø12 bar. Its radial
    retract at Z 16 (r 4.3 -> 6.85) sweeps the neck's uncut r 5.1..6
    band. Recorded as one added WARN line in the golden; the program
    text is unchanged and the gate refuses it. The fixture's op naming is
    the cause; it was left as is to keep the translation golden stable.
- **Split for the size budget:** the drill-pilot credit moved to
  `operation/turning_credit.rs`.

### PR #135 fifth review

- **B2:** the blade-band widening of a kerf now applies only to THIS op's
  own cuts. An op ahead keeps its own reach, so another tool's cut is
  never measured by this blade's band. Pinned:
  `a_banded_rapid_just_under_an_earlier_face_cut_is_convicted`.
- **Fixture:** `profile_rough_and_finish_post_to_the_lathe_golden` names
  its finish S1, so the rough (R1) posts first and the golden is a
  program the gate accepts. Its diff is the two sections swapped (the G50
  clamp stays on the first) and P1's WARN line gone; checked by script.
  Finish ahead of rough is pinned on its own:
  `a_finish_posted_ahead_of_its_rough_is_convicted_by_name`.
- **Docs:** `kerf_of` states the helix approximation (constant radius
  credits the crests; safe only for today's thread kernel). `outward`
  states the OD assumption (an internal blade must flip it or pass None).
- **B1** (the turned op's stamp does not digest the ops ahead) is covered
  by PR #153, stacked on this branch; not duplicated here.

## #38: G41/G42 wear compensation - the centre path under the register's wear delta (2026-11-08)

**`Compensation::Wear` joins Computer and Control on the contour's
`Approach`** (default Computer: every golden byte-identical; the project
file gains an additive `wear_comp` key, the digest a byte only when on).
Wear walks the SAME centre path Control does - same mid-run seam, same
straight leads at least a radius long, same doors (tabs, blends, overlap,
keep-down links, open contours and runs, 3+2 tilt), refused under the name
"wear compensation" - and its `CompSpan` (flag `wear`) programs those
centre moves verbatim under G41/G42 Dn / G40: the machine-tool handbooks'
wear-offset practice, where the register holds only the wear delta (zero
on a new cutter). The stream marks it `COMP LEFT|RIGHT <µm> WEAR`, the
engine publishes `CompensationType` ("wear" / "control"), and Fanuc writes
the same words plus one comment per section saying the D register holds
the wear delta only - a full radius there would cut the part a radius
undersize, and that is the one wrong set-up wear invites. Haas/Mazak/
Sinumerik/Heidenhain and the lathe keep refusing any COMP by name.
Considered and dropped: keeping the lead law only for Control (a wear
delta is small, but the control still builds the vector over the engage
block - a zero-length or arc engage is still a misread program), skipping
the room law for wear (the centre path is already proved; the room law
judges the part offset by a full radius, which wear never asks - so it is
skipped, not reused), and a separate wear register number (the library
carries none; D = tool number, as Control).

## #20 - the rotary sweep's flute-rotation bound: stated always, enforced on request (2026-11-08, M13.1)

**What "flute rotation" is here.** Not the helical flutes spinning (the
sim's tool is already its body of revolution, which bounds any flute
geometry): it is the rotary chord pre-pass (`stock_sim/field_rotary.rs`)
standing each sub-chord's whole tool on the sub-chord's MID pose while
the true pose turns through it. A tool point at distance `w` from the
tool's reference (ball center, flat tip) is off its true-pose place by
at most `w·2·sin(β/2)`, `β ≤ half_angle` (Craig, "Introduction to
Robotics", ch. 2 - the chord of a rigid turn). The old chord count only
bounded the SAG at the farthest reach (second order), so the flank's
error (first order, `L·α`) was unstated - the "7.9e-4 at tol 1e-4"
reading of the M13.1 parity.

**The bound.** `RotaryChordStats::flute_shift = L·2·sin(half_angle/2)`,
`L` = the farthest corner of the field's bounds from the tip at either
station (plus `r` for a ball), capped at shank + `r` - only points inside
the field cut, so nothing farther counts. With `center_sag` it is a
two-sided Hausdorff bound: every point of the true sweep has a chorded
point within `center_sag + flute_shift`, and back, so any point farther
than that from the true skin reads the right steel/air. It is two-sided
by nature, not one-signed: the chorded solid is neither a superset nor a
subset of the true one (the brief's "never smaller" is not a property of
this law, and neither direction would be conservative for every consumer:
over-removal hides rest material, under-removal invents gouges).

**Enforced on request.** `Stock::simulate_rotary_bounded(.., Some(t))`
(and `ChordLaw::flute_tol`) also counts sub-chords until
`L·2·sin(half/2) ≤ t`; refused by name past `MAX_SUBCHORDS`, never
coarsened. `simulate_rotary` keeps today's count (flute tolerance
`None`): the eye and the slices are unchanged in cost and output. On the
pinning fixture (flat d6, 30 degrees on a d20 bar, pose_tol 1e-3) the
unenforced stat reads 0.147 mm at 44 sub-chords; enforcing 0.05 takes
130.

**Agreement tests** (`crates/sim/tests/stock_rotary_flute.rs`): the field
against a brute-force reference (the flat tool at 4,001 samples of the
controller's lerp, its own sampling error added to the margin) at every
field cell center in the band: 0 sign misses past `center_sag +
flute_shift` (17,144 points) and 0 past an enforced 0.05 (17,280); and at
the sag class alone the worst miss is 9.5e-3 > 5.5e-3 - the flute error
is real and the bound is what covers it.

**Dropped:** (1) enforcing `α ≤ tol/L` at the eye's or verdict's pose
tolerance by default - 3x-1000x the sub-chords (the eye 2.5 s would go
to minutes) for a flank class no current consumer reads (the column
verdict refuses rotary by name); a caller that needs it asks for it.
(2) a one-signed inflation (cut with `r + flute_shift`) - no consumer is
conservative in a single direction. (3) a second-order "scallop" law for
radial poses - true only when the pose's turn is parallel to the tip
chord, which the straight tip chord itself breaks by up to half a move's
turn. (4) sampling the reference between field cell centers - the field's
`distance` reads its cell's value, and that quantization (up to ~0.26 mm
at cell 0.5) would be charged to the flute.

## #152 - a short turned bar's axis is read off its facing flats (2026-11-08)

- **Chosen:** when the area-weighted normal moment is isotropic (both
  smaller eigenvalues past ISO = 0.5 of the largest), the fit no longer
  refuses outright. It offers the part's flat POLES as candidate axes:
  normals (sign-folded) that one cluster of facets shares, carrying at
  least 5 % of the area, at most 3, largest first
  (`multiaxis/axis_poles.rs`). The same concurrency and coarseness
  judgement of `axis.rs` decides; an isotropic part no pole earns is
  refused by the old name ("every axis fits this model equally"). The
  poles are also offered next to the two eigen candidates when the
  moment is not isotropic, since near isotropy the eigenvectors are
  ill-conditioned; the residual ranks them and the eigen candidate
  wins ties, so an even revolve keeps its bits.
- **Re-centred pole line:** on the short bar one radial hole drags the
  plain least-squares line 0.4 mm toward it, past the 3 % sagitta band,
  and half the wall misses it. A pole candidate whose plain line fails
  is re-centred by least trimmed squares (refit on the half of the
  normal lines that miss least, until that half settles), then judged
  on every facet as before; `axis_robust` then trims and tightens as
  for any fit. Only pole candidates get this, so no eigen-path fit
  changes.
- **Review of PR #204 (re-centring guards, all three kept):** a
  100 x 100 x 10 plate with an r5 boss at (20, 20) read as a trusted
  (0.667, 0.667, 0.333) axis: the trimmed half was taken by facet count
  (the boss is 792 of 804 facets, 1.3 % of the area), and the plate's
  two-triangle faces put every normal line through its centre, which
  any line through it meets - `judge` is necessary, not sufficient.
  Now (1) the median is AREA-weighted, (2) the kept half must carry
  `MIN_KEPT_SHARE` of the answering area on `MIN_KEPT` facets (shared
  with `axis_robust::reweigh`), and (3) re-centring runs only when the
  moment is isotropic - elsewhere the plain line's drag stays the
  evidence it was on main. (3) is what refuses the plate (its moment
  is not isotropic); (1) and (2) guard an isotropic part the same way.
  Pinned: `a_plate_with_an_off_centre_boss_is_refused_by_name`. The
  wrong axes the review found on main (boss at (10, 0); single-band
  shaft with a D-flat) are left to their own issue.
- **`punched_bar` stays at z -80..20:** back at r10 x 40 the
  three-hole box fixtures (`drilling_cross_box`) still refuse - three
  holes plus their images are past the 10 % concurrency share on the
  short bar. Not a fixture-length tweak, so left.
- **Why:** a revolve's facing cut is a flat whose normal is the axis
  (on the Gauss map, a flat is one point; the lateral zone a circle
  about it). A bar at 0.5 < L/D < 2 balances caps against walls and
  the moment names no direction, but its caps still do. A sphere has
  no flat of any share; a cube's faces are flats, but four bearings
  about any of them fail the coarseness gate, so both are still
  refused by name.
- **Dropped:** testing isotropy on the lateral facets alone (needs a
  candidate axis to sort lateral from axial first - the same
  chicken-and-egg the poles break); an exhaustive direction search
  over normal-pair cross products (O(n^2), and a sphere passes the
  concurrency law about every direction through its centre, so a
  search finds a false axis); lowering ISO (moves the knife-edge, does
  not remove it). A revolve with no flat end (domed or pointed both
  ends) near L/D 1..2 is still refused; none is known to be needed.

## #208 - normal lines through one point cannot certify an axis (2026-11-08)

- **Decided:** a point-concurrency guard in the axis judgement
  (`crates/motion/src/multiaxis/axis_point.rs`). Find the point the
  candidate's inlier normal lines meet best (area-weighted
  least-squares point of nearest approach, refitted on the area half
  that misses it least). When the lines through that point (within the
  sagitta tolerance) carry half the inlier area or more, the coarseness
  gate is applied to those facets alone: their own bearings about the
  axis must leave no skip past the sagitta budget. Otherwise the
  candidate fails and the fit refuses by name as before ("share no
  rotation axis" / "every axis fits ... equally"). Plus, on an
  isotropic part a pole (facing-flat) axis is no longer tilted by the
  direction refinement. The guard alone already refuses the cube; this
  is a second safeguard asked for in the re-review of PR #204.
- **Why:** two-triangle faces anchor their normal lines at the face
  centre, so a box's faces all meet at its centre; a single-band wall's
  lines all meet at the bar's mid point. Lines through one point meet
  every line through it, so the concurrency share passed for any
  direction through the point, and a small finely meshed boss or cross
  hole supplied the bearings. A pencil of lines has no direction of its
  own; it can only stand for a revolve when it is itself rotationally
  symmetric about the axis (the Gauss map of a revolve is circles about
  the axis). A box's faces bear 2-4 azimuths about any axis; a
  single-band shaft's wall bears all of them about its own axis and two
  about a cross one. So the common single-band CAD cylinder still fits
  (pinned: `a_single_band_bar_still_fits_its_true_axis`), and plates,
  cubes and cross readings are refused.
- **Considered and dropped:** (b) sub-sampling big facets into many
  lines: the circumcenter anchor is what makes a turned facet's line
  meet the axis exactly; samples elsewhere on a wall facet miss it by
  up to half a chord, so every coarse revolve would lose concurrency.
  (a) requiring the contact points to spread along the axis: it refuses
  the single-band cylinder, the most common real STL, whose direction
  the Gauss map does fix. (c) refusing whenever the inliers are mostly
  point-concurrent: same single-band loss. An EGI second-moment
  symmetry test: a square plate is second-moment symmetric about its
  normal, so it would pass a plate-with-boss about the plate centre.
- **Cost / caveat:** the guard can only refuse. A single-band shaft
  with a keyway or D-flat wider than the sagitta skip (about 28 degrees
  of bearing on each side of the feature's own facets) in its
  point-concurrent wall is refused rather than read (the issue's
  shaft-with-D-flat fixture is refused this way, which the issue
  allows). Five-band and banded shafts are untouched: their lines meet
  the axis at several points, so no point carries half the area.

### #208, review of PR #223: pencils judged one by one; only inliers vouch for roundness

- **Decided:** (1) the coarseness gate reads only the facets whose
  normal lines MEET the candidate axis; outliers (an off-centre boss)
  no longer supply bearings. (2) The inliers are peeled into pencils
  (lines through one point, one after another, up to 12, each of at
  least 5 % of the inlier area), and each pencil is judged by itself:
  its area-weighted low trigonometric moments about the axis (k = 1..4)
  must vanish. The moments times the pencil's area, summed, may total
  at most 10 % of the inlier area (the same 10 % the concurrency share
  allows to miss). A pencil holding half the inliers must still pass
  the coarseness gate alone.
- **Why:** with sides split into three or more rectangles, no one
  point held half the area, so the first guard never fired; and two
  crossed single-band rods are two pencils at ONE point, whose union
  looked round about the cross axis. A revolve's ring spreads its area
  evenly over the bearings (all moments below its segment count
  vanish); a crossing rod's wall puts its share s on two opposite
  bearings (k = 2 moment s), a box's faces on four (k = 4).
- **Dropped:** Kuiper's statistic against the uniform circle (tried
  first): it reads two opposite lumps at only half their share (0.19
  for a crossing rod holding 37 %), the same as a D-flat's single lump
  that a real part needs to pass, so no threshold separated them. The
  moments do: a flat that lumps a cut arc's area on one bearing keeps
  the low moments nearly whole (about 0.015 at k = 2 for a 1 mm flat
  on r10).
- **Cost:** crossed rods of any proportion are refused (fail closed),
  including a short cross pin holding more than about 10 % of the
  inlier area. A single-band shaft whose keyway or flat is wide enough
  to move the first moment past 10 % is refused.

### #208, second re-review of PR #223: rings by latitude class, latitude must not run with bearing

- **Decided:** the per-pencil moment test (e883ae6) is replaced by two
  tests on each pencil. (1) **Latitude classes:** the pencil's facets
  are sorted by latitude `n . u` and split where it jumps by more than
  0.01. Each narrow class (range at most 0.05) must hold a ring, with
  its widest bearing skip within twice the sagitta budget; a class
  that holds none counts its area as off the axis. Flats at a ring's
  latitude ride with it (a D-flat; a square plate's sides round a
  centred bore; a keyway floor in its band). (2) **Off-cone share:**
  the share of the latitude's variance (and of its squared deviation)
  that the first two bearing harmonics explain (trigonometric
  regression, Mardia & Jupp). It counts only when the explained swing
  exceeds 2e-3 (about 0.1 degrees; the jittered-mesh pins explain at
  most 3.3e-4). Both are summed, weighted by area, and capped at 10 %
  of the inliers, as before.
- **Why:** a skewed cross's shaft wall, seen from the rod's axis (or
  from a line between the two), is a squashed ring: its bearings stay
  spread, so the moments read it at only (1 - cos ang)/2, but its
  latitude swings once per turn. A revolve's ring keeps one latitude.
  The moment test also refused a square plate with a centred bore,
  because the plate's four sides sit in the bore's pencil; by latitude
  class they ride with the bore's ring, as a D-flat does. A 90-degree
  cross folds the crossing wall onto two bearings at many latitudes,
  so each of those classes holds no ring.
- **Dropped:** the bearing moments of the whole pencil (they refused
  plate-with-bore and missed skewed crosses); R^2 with no absolute
  floor (a jittered shaft's correlated rounding explained up to 19 %
  of its tiny latitude variance); a strict sagitta budget per class (a
  keyway confined to one band leaves 30-degree skips beside its floor).
- **Cost:** a skewed cross under about 0.1 degrees passes as one axis,
  which is harmless at that angle. A finely meshed dome whose latitude
  steps are under 0.01 is one wide class, judged by the off-cone share
  alone.

## Issue #130 - turning kinds approach from the stock

- **Envelope = one radius.** The kernels get `StockEnv { r_out, clearance }`:
  the stock's widest radius about the part's fitted axis (vertex max, the
  same reading the meridian law's outline starts from). Chosen over a
  per-station outline: a scalar is conservative for every rapid, and the
  extra rungs it adds over a pre-turned blank are air cuts, never gouges.
- **Only a bar wider than the part counts** (`r_out > part r_max + 1e-6`).
  A bar-sized stock keeps today's part-based program bit for bit, so the
  lathe goldens did not move. Dropped: always adding the clearance, which
  would have moved every snug-bar program by a millimetre for no safety.
- **Retract clearance = 1.0 mm on radius** (`turning_stock::STOCK_CLEARANCE`),
  a constant for now. It belongs as a per-op parameter with that default
  (CAM choices are user parameters); a follow-up issue should expose it.
- **Profile rough** counts its rungs from the bar's OD down to the part
  plus leave, and drops a rung whose nose never reaches under the OD
  (pure air). Groove rough and parting peck from the OD. Profile finish,
  groove finish, threading and form only move their rapids out.
- **Not touched:** Facing (#122, claimed by an outside contributor), the
  contour rides (chamfer, taper, multi-pass - not in the issue), and the
  boring bar, whose approach is already centred on the spindle - the most
  room any stock ID allows; a stock hole too small for the bar stays the
  meridian law's refusal.
- **No stock readable** (no setup stock, an empty mesh, an axis fit that
  fails): the part-based path stands and carries the note "no setup stock
  could be read about the spindle ...".
- **Fixture:** `turning_profile.rs` moved from a 40 mm box to bar-sized
  stock (as #103 did for the other lathe fixtures): with #130 the box's
  28 mm revolved corner made its ladder-count pins a 30-rung job.


## #54: the rotary wrap closes a flatted bar's seam with curtains, and refuses an open mesh up front (2026-11-08)

**Chosen:** the developed sheet's two free seam ends are closed by a CURTAIN per free
seam edge (`multiaxis::rotary_seam`): the vertical quad from the developed edge down to
the floor radius. A seam edge is an edge the two facets sharing it develop one period
apart; its lower version (first copy) and its upper version (second copy) are the
cover's ends. This replaces the meridian wall that stood in the plane of the cover's
extreme column. On a revolve the curtain is that wall, split on the same diagonal (the
OffsetRings digest is unchanged). On a D-flat across the seam the seam column is ragged
(the flat's vertices sit at their own azimuths), and the plane wall met none of its
edges: the "mesh is open, 4/8/16 dangling chord ends" of #9 round 2.

**Also chosen:** the wrap refuses an open mesh by name before it develops it ("the
rotary wrap needs a closed solid, but the mesh is open: N edges bound one facet only").
On main a hole in the skin that no ladder level slices through wrapped silently.

**Dropped:**
- Widening the plane wall to the ragged column (a skirt from each seam edge to the
  s_lo plane): two surfaces where one does, and the wall's profile had to stay a single
  valued function of the station.
- Curtaining every free edge: it would close a real hole silently.
- Putting the seam end-to-end test in `rotary_adaptive.rs` (the issue's "Done means"):
  that file sits at the 400-line budget, so the D-flat suite `rotary_dflat.rs` carries it.


### PR #210 review: a flat across the seam is refused by name, not wrapped

**Chosen:** the wrap refuses by name any work whose seam is not turned
(`rotary_seam::refuse_feature_on_seam`). The off-axis vertices of the facets that
straddle the ±π branch must stand on exactly two meridian columns with one profile. A
flat, keyway or cross hole across the seam breaks that, and the refusal says to rotate
the work clear of it.

**Why:** the review probe (a 3.5 deep flat off its centre across the seam) wrapped and
put 12 to 1606 cut tips inside the part, down to the axis. Clipping the cover to the
ragged seam chains' inner columns removed the reviewer's strip gouge. A second gouge
was left, though: a whole-lap band at the flat's end stations, at the shoulder plus the
pad. It showed even with the flat centred on the seam (n=64, D2: 245 tips), so a
cover-shape fix was not enough. Gouge-free beats coverage. The placements clear of the
seam were checked against the true cross-section polygon (n 16/64, D2/D0.8) with 0 tips
inside, and they wrap as before.

**Dropped:**
- The ragged-cover clip (it only removed the strip gouge).
- The #9 seam-law end-to-end pin under Adaptive: its fixture is a flat across the seam,
  which is now refused. The seam law stays unit-pinned. The pin now asserts the named
  refusal under Adaptive and Offset rings.
- Not done (follow-up worth an issue): rotate the development's branch to an azimuth
  where the work is turned, so a D-flat bar wraps whatever its placement.

## #197 - the Stock page shows the models' size (2026-11-07)

- **Chosen:** a two-line readout above the stock fields - "Models: X x Y x
  Z <unit>" and the X/Y/Z extents - from `model::solid_world_aabb`, the
  very box Fit to Models wraps (its hover says so), in the document's
  units; with no models, a dim "No models yet" line.
- **Why:** the reporter wanted the primitive's dimensions in view while
  typing stock numbers.
- **Dropped:** the *selected* model's box only (the stock wraps the whole
  job, and Fit already reads all models); copying the size into the
  fields on a click (Fit to Models already does it with a margin; the
  per-side allowance is #198).

## #198 - box stock fitted per side (2026-11-07)

- **Chosen:** for box stock the Stock page offers "Per side": six
  allowances (-X, +X, -Y, +Y, bottom, top) replace the single fit margin,
  and Fit to Models sends `StockFitSides`, which wraps the models' box by
  each side's own amount (`stock::fit_box_sides`: each face its own
  allowance off the models; refused by name for a negative or
  non-finite allowance) through the same undoable `SetStock` as the
  single-margin fit (both now share `State::apply_stock_fit`). Equal
  sides read exactly as the single-margin fit.
- **Why:** a blank is rarely padded evenly - a facing allowance on top,
  nothing under a flat bottom, more on the side a vise jaw grips.
- **Dropped:** per-side for cylinders (a radial allowance is one number;
  bottom/top could follow if asked); storing the allowances in the
  document (they are a fit recipe, not stock - the stock stays the
  explicit box the fit produced).
